cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.2.7.1_p2,mosquitoes;mosquito,"There is increasing evidence of the role of extreme events in disease outbreaks  (very high confidence)  (Tjaden et al., 2018; Bryson et al., 2020). Heat waves have been associated with outbreaks of helminth pathogens, especially in sub-Arctic and Arctic areas. For example, a severe outbreak of microfilaremia, a VBD spread by mosquitoes and flies, plagued reindeer in northern Europe following extreme high temperatures (Laaksonen et al., 2010). More frequent and severe extreme events such as floods, droughts, heat waves and storms can either increase or decrease outbreaks, depending upon the region and disease (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Anyamba et al., 2001; Marcheggiani et al., 2010; Brown and Murray, 2013; Paz, 2015; Boyce et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016b; Wilcox et al., 2019; Nosrat et al., 2021). Heavy precipitation events have been shown to increase some infectious diseases with aquatic life-cycle components such as mosquito-borne, helminth, and rodent-borne diseases (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Anyamba et al., 2001; Zhou et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2008; Brown and Murray, 2013; Anyamba et al., 2014; Boyce et al., 2016). Conversely, flooding also increases flow rate and decreases parasite load and diversity in other aquatic wildlife (Hallett and Bartholomew, 2008; Bjork and Bartholomew, 2009; Marcogliese, 2016; Marcogliese et al., 2016) and can reduce mosquito abundance by flushing them out of the system (Paaijmans et al., 2007; Paz, 2015)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.2.7.1_p3,mosquitoes;mosquito;aedes,"Droughts reduce the aquatic habitat of some mosquito species while simultaneously increasing the availability of stagnant standing pools of water that are ideal breeding habitats for other species, such as dengue-vector Aedes mosquitoes (medium evidence, medium agreement ) (Chareonviriyaphap et al., 2003; Chretien et al., 2007; Padmanabha et al., 2010; Trewin et al., 2013; Paz, 2015). Extreme drought has been associated with an increase in bluetongue virus haemorrhagic disease in wildlife in eastern North America, although the mechanisms involved were not identified (Christensen et al., 2020). Heat waves in some regions, especially coastal regions, have increased parasitism and decreased host richness and abundance, leading to population crashes (Larsen and Mouritsen, 2014; Mouritsen et al., 2018). Changes in temperature and precipitation, especially extreme events, can alter community structure (Larsen et al., 2011) by increasing or decreasing parasites and their host organisms, and even altering host behaviour in ways that are advantageous to parasites (Macnab and Barber, 2012)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.2.8_p4,mosquitoes;drosophila;wyeomyia,"Away from range margins, individual populations experiencing regional warming have evolved diverse traits related to climate adaptation. For example, pitcher-plant mosquitoes (Wyeomyia smithii)  in Pacific Northwest America have evolved to wait for shorter days before initiating diapause. This adaptation to lengthening summers enables them to delay overwintering until later and add an extra generation each year (Bradshaw and Holzapfel, 2001). Among 26 populations of Drosophila subobscura studied on three continents, 22 experienced climate warming across two or more decades, and 21 of these 22 showed increasing frequency of the chromosome inversion characteristic of populations adapted to hot climates  (robust evidence, high agreement)  (Balanya et al., 2006)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#FAQ 2.2_p4,mosquitoes;sand flies,"Climate change further increases risk by altering pathogen and host animal (1) geographic ranges and habitats; (2) survival, growth and development; (3) reproduction and replication; (4) transmission and exposure (5) behaviour; and (6) access to immunologically naïve animals and people who lack resistance to infection. This can lead to novel disease emergence in new places, more frequent and larger outbreaks, and longer or shifted seasons of transmission. Climate change is making it possible for many EIDs to colonise historically colder areas that are becoming warmer and wetter in temperate and polar regions and in the mountains. Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are diseases spread by vectors such as mosquitoes, sand flies, kissing bugs and ticks. For example, ticks that carry the virus that causes tick-borne encephalitis have moved into the northern subarctic regions of Asia and Europe. Viruses like dengue, chikungunya and Japanese encephalitis are emerging in Nepal in hilly and mountainous areas. Novel outbreaks of Vibrio bacteria seafood poisoning are being traced to the the Baltic States and Alaska where they were never documented before. Many scientific studies show that the transmission of infectious disease and the number of individuals infected depends on rainfall and temperature; climate change often makes these conditions more favourable for disease transmission."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#FAQ 2.2_p5,mosquitoes;mosquito;aedes;aedes aegypti,"Climate change can also have complicated, compounding and contradictory effects on pathogens and vectors. Increased rainfall creates more habitat for mosquitoes that transmit diseases like malaria, but too much rain washes away the habitat. Decreased rainfall also increases disease risk when people without reliable access to water use containers to store water where mosquitoes, such as the vectors of dengue fever Aedes aegypti and A. albopictus, lay their eggs. Hotter temperatures also increase mosquito-bite rate, parasite development and viral replication! Certain species of snails are intermediate hosts for many helminth parasites that make humans, livestock and wild animals sick. When it gets hot, the snails can produce 2–3 times as many infective larvae; however, if it becomes too hot, many pathogens and their vectors cannot survive or reproduce."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.6.4_p6,mosquitoes,"Another example of a public adaptation measure is the protection and restoration of natural areas, which have the potential to decrease the transmission of water- and vector-borne infectious diseases (medium confidence: robust evidence, low agreement ). Studies have shown that these measures can diminish the cases of malaria and diarrhoea in Brazil and cases of diarrhoea in children in Colombia (Bauch et al., 2015; Herrera et al., 2017; Chaves et al., 2018). However, deforestation and malaria have a complex relationship that relies on local context interactions, where land use and land cover changes play an important role due to vector ecology alterations and social conditions of human settlements (Rubio-Palis et al., 2013). Forest conservation can improve hydrological cycle control and soil erosion that can help to improve water quality and reduce the burden of water-borne diseases. In addition, forest cover can help to diminish the habitat for larval mosquitoes that transmit malaria. These measures can help to design policies at sites where these problems do not currently exist but can emerge as a consequence of climate change and the increase in the frequency of weather extreme events."

There is increasing evidence that climate warming has extended the elevational distribution of Anopheles, Culex and Aedes mosquito vectors above 2000 m in Nepal (limited evidence, high agreement ) (Dahal, 2008; Dhimal et al., 2014a; Dhimal et al., 2014b; Dhimal et al., 2015), with similar trends being recorded in neighbouring Himalayan regions (medium evidence, high agreement ) (Phuyal et al., 2020; Dhimal et al., 2021). Host animals in novel areas may be immunologically naive, and therefore more vulnerable to severe illness (Bradley et al., 2005; Hall et al., 2016)."

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.6.4_p4,mosquito,"Participatory management can be relevant in the case of mosquito-borne disease prevention (e.g., dengue fever or malaria), where the reduction in mosquito habitat in one area or ‘hotspot’ can reduce the risk for all surrounding households. This approach is also relevant when considering new places where vector-borne diseases can emerge because of changes in climate (Andersson et al., 2015)."

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.3.2.4_p5,aedes;aedes aegypti,"Increases in vector-borne diseases can be related to increases in rainfall and minimum temperatures during ENSO events (Stewart-Ibarra and Lowe, 2013) and the expansion of the diseases’ altitudinal distribution (high confidence) (Lowe et al., 2017; Lippi et al., 2019; Portilla Cabrera and Selvaraj, 2020). ENSO events have been related to such diseases as dengue and leptospirosis (Quintero-Herrera et al., 2015; Sánchez et al., 2017; Arias-Monsalve and Builes-Jaramillo, 2019); they can also lead to an increased incidence of chikungunya (Sections 7.2.2.1 and 7.3.1.3). Precipitation, relative humidity and temperature have influenced dengue incidence in recent years (Mattar et al., 2013) (Table 12.1). Dengue cases are predicted to increase in the 1.5°C and the 3.7°C warming scenarios by 2050 and 2100, with increases ranging from 28,900 to 88,800 in Peru, 34,600 to 110,000 in Ecuador, and 97,400 to 317,000 in Colombia, although these scenarios do not consider the potential effects of vaccines or socioeconomic trajectories (Colón-González et al., 2018). Other studies found that Aedes aegypti (arbovirus vector) will shift into higher elevations, increasing the populations at risk (Figure 12.5) (Lippi et al., 2019). Climate change will contribute to increased malaria vectorial capacity (high confidence) (Section 7.2.2.1) (Laporta et al., 2015). Increases in minimum temperature were associated with historical malaria transmission when taking into consideration disease control interventions and climate factors (Fletcher et al., 2020). Figure 12.4 shows mixed changes in the number of months suitable for malaria transmission, with low-lying areas in coastal regions becoming more suitable. Zoonotic tick-borne diseases and the epidemiology of tuberculosis are also influenced (Garcia-Solorzano et al., 2019; Rodriguez-Morales et al., 2019)."

The southwestern South America (SWS) and southern South America (SSA) sub-regions are not presented because the vector is not abundant in these areas and the estimated R0 is lower than 0.01. Data were derived from Romanello et al. (2021)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.3.6.4_p3,aedes;aedes aegypti,"Warming temperatures have been implicated in the emergence of dengue in temperate latitudes, increasing populations of Aedes aegypti (high confidence) (Natiello et al., 2008; Robert et al., 2019, 2020; Estallo et al., 2020; López et al., 2021) (Table 12.1), and field studies have demonstrated the role of local climate in vector activity (Benitez et al., 2021). Figure 12.5 shows the modelled transmission suitability for dengue for two climate-change scenarios. Future increases in the number of months suitable for transmission of dengue will be highest in SES (see SM12.8 for additional information). There is additional evidence of the spread of arbovirus into southern temperate latitudes (Basso et al., 2017); however, a longer historical time series is needed to understand climate–disease interactions, given the relatively recent emergence of arborvirus in this region."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.6.1_p3,aedes,"Epidemic forecast tools are an example of an adaptation measure being developed and/or implemented in this region (high confidence). Climate-driven forecast models have been developed for dengue in Ecuador, Puerto Rico, Peru, Brazil, Mexico, Dominican Republic, and Colombia (Lowe et al., 2013; Eastin et al., 2014; Johansson et al., 2016; Lowe et al., 2017; Johansson et al., 2019); for Zika virus infections across the Americas (Muñoz et al., 2017); for cutaneous leishmaniasis in Costa Rica and Brazil (Chaves and Pascual, 2006; Lewnard et al., 2014); for Aedes-borne diseases across the Americas (Muñoz et al., 2020b); and a nowcast model for chikungunya virus infections across the Americas (Johansson et al., 2014). In Ecuador, a prototype system utilised forecasts of seasonal climate and ENSO forecasts of to predict dengue transmission, providing the health sector with warnings of increased transmission several months ahead of time (Stewart-Ibarra and Lowe, 2013; Lowe et al., 2017). Despite these advances, few tools have become operational and mainstreamed in decision making processes. However, Brazil and Panama have been able to operationalise an EWS for the surveillance of dengue fever transmission (Codeço et al., 2016; McDonald et al., 2016)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.2.2_p3,chironomidae,"Freshwater population extinctions are mainly due to habitat loss, the introduction of alien species, pollution, over-harvesting (Gozlan et al., 2019; IPBES, 2019) and climate change-induced epidemic diseases (Pounds et al., 2006)(see Section 2.4.2.7.1). Climate warming, particularly through the intensification and severity of droughts, contributes to the disappearance of small ponds which hold rare and endemic species (Bagella et al., 2016). Systematic data on the extent and biology of small ponds is, however, lacking on the global scale. Extreme heat waves can lead to large local fish kills in lakes (see Section 2.3.3.5), when water temperature and oxygen concentrations surpass critical thresholds and threatening cold-water fish and amphibians (Thompson et al., 2012). Evidence of a local extinction of some invertebrate species with a 1.4°C–1.7°C rise in mean annual stream winter temperature from 1981 to 2005 was reported in Abrahams et al. (2013). Population declines of specialist species in glacier-fed streams, such as the non-biting midge Diamesa davisi (Chironomidae), can be attributed to climate-change-driven glacier retreat (Cauvy-Fraunié and Dangles, 2019), and the flatworm Crenobia alpina (Planariidae) has been reported as locally extinct in the Welsh Llyn Brianne river (Durance and Ormerod, 2010; Larsen et al., 2018)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.2.8_p7,drosophila,"For example, as temperature was experimentally increased, the amount of genetic variance in the fitness of Drosophila melanogaster decreased; in hot environments, flies had low evolvability (Kristensen et al., 2015). The hypothesis that heat-stress tolerance is evolutionarily constrained is further supported by experiments in which 22Drosophila spp. drawn from tropical and temperate climes were subjected to extremes of heat and cold. They differed, as expected, in cold tolerances, but not in heat tolerances nor in temperatures at which optimal performances were observed (MacLean et al., 2019b)."
