cleaned_content/wg1/Chapter03#3.5.2.2_p2,China;India,"Considerable changes to observed broad- or basin-scale ocean near-surface salinity fields have been reported (see Section 2.3.3.2), and these have been linked to changes in the evaporation minus precipitation patterns at the ocean surface through model simulations, typically expressing a pattern of change where climatological mean fresh regions become fresher and corresponding salty regions becoming saltier (Durack et al., 2012, 2013; Zika et al., 2015; Lago et al., 2016; Skliris et al., 2016, 2018; Cheng et al., 2020), also broadly present in the CMIP6 multi-model mean (Figure 3.27). At basin-scales, the depth-integrated effect of mean salinity changes as captured in halosteric sea level for the top 0 to 2000 m has also been assessed based on observational products, and these results mirror near-surface patterns in the CMIP5 and CMIP6 models, with most areas that are becoming fresher at the surface exhibiting increases in halosteric sea level, and areas becoming saltier exhibiting decreases (Durack et al., 2014a; Figure 3.28). Further investigations using observations and models together have tied the long-term patterns of surface and subsurface salinity changes to coincident changes to the evaporation minus precipitation field over the ocean (Durack et al., 2012, 2013; Durack, 2015; Levang and Schmitt, 2015; Zika et al., 2015, 2018; Grist et al., 2016; Lago et al., 2016; Cheng et al., 2020), however the rate of these changes through time continues to be an active area of active research (Skliris et al., 2014; Zika et al., 2015, 2018; Cheng et al., 2020; Sallée et al., 2021)."

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.2.4_p2,China,"Taxonomic groups have differed in their responses (Parmesan, 2007; Thackeray et al., 2010), and a few have completely diverged from general trends. For example, seabirds continue to breed with their pre-climate-change phenologies (Keogan et al., 2018). Newer reviews and analyses reveal differences in responses across continents and time intervals (Piao et al., 2019). Mean advance in days per decade for plants was 5.5 in China and 3.0–4.2 in Europe, but only 0.9 in North America (Piao et al., 2019). Mean values for the retardation of autumn leaf fall, which can be more influenced by photoperiod and less by temperature than spring leaf-out, were 0.36 days per decade in Europe (Menzel et al., 2020), 2.6 days per decade in China and around 3 days per decade in the USA (medium evidence, high agreement ) (Piao et al., 2019)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.3.2.1_p3,China;Switzerland;Russia;Canada;Nepal,"Other biome shifts consistent with climate change and not substantially affected by local land use include: northward shifts in Canada of deciduous forest into boreal conifer forest, 5 km from 1970–2012 (Sittaro et al., 2017) and 20 km from 1970–2014 (Boisvert-Marsh et al., 2019) and of temperate conifer into boreal conifer forest, 21 km from 1970–2015 (Boisvert-Marsh and de Blois, 2021). Research detected upslope shifts of boreal and sub-alpine conifer forest into alpine grassland at 143 sites on four continents (41 m from 1901–2018) (Lu et al., 2021) and at individual sites in Canada (54 m from 1900–2010) (Davis et al., 2020); China (300 m from 1910–2000) (Liang et al., 2016) (33 m from 1985–2014) (Du et al., 2018); Nepal (50 m from 1860–2000) (Sigdel et al., 2018); Russia (150 m from 1954–2006) (Gatti et al., 2019); and the USA (19 m from 1950–2016) (Smithers et al., 2018) (38 m from 1953–2015) (Terskaia et al., 2020). Other upslope cases include shifts of temperate conifer forest in Canada (Jackson et al., 2016) and the USA (Lubetkin et al., 2017), temperate deciduous forest in Switzerland (Rigling et al., 2013) and temperate shrubland in the USA (Donato et al., 2016)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.3.5_p4,China,"The global extent of grasslands is declining significantly because of climate change (medium confidence). In temperate and boreal zones, where about half of tree lines are shifting, they are overwhelmingly expanding poleward and upward, with an accompanying loss of montane and boreal grassland (robust evidence, high agreement ) whereas tropical tree lines have been generally stable (medium evidence, medium agreement ) (Harsch et al., 2009; Rehm and Feeley, 2015; Silva et al., 2016; Andela et al., 2017; Song et al., 2018; Aide et al., 2019; Gibson and Newman, 2019). The Eurasian steppes experienced a 1% increase in woody cover per decade since 2000 (Liu et al., 2021) and inner Mongolian grasslands in China experienced broad encroachment as well (Chen et al., 2015). Climatic drivers of woody expansion in temperature-limited grasslands, particularly alpine grasslands, are most frequently attributed to warming (robust evidence, high agreement , high confidence) (D’Odorico et al., 2012; Hagedorn et al., 2014), an increase in water and nutrient availability from thawing permafrost (medium evidence, high agreement ) (Zhou et al., 2015b; Silva et al., 2016) and rising CO2 (medium evidence, medium agreement ) (Frank et al., 2015; Aide et al., 2019). Interactions of LULCCs such as land abandonment, grazing management shifts and fire suppression with climate change are contributing factors (Liu et al., 2021)"
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.1.3.2_p5,China;Australia,"Regional threats from climate change have been reported for 40% of amphibians in China, (Wu, 2020), 33% of European freshwater fish species (Janssen et al., 2016) and 56–69% of odonates in Australia, (Bush et al., 2014b). Assessment of site-specific extirpation for 88 aquatic insect taxa projected that climate change-induced hydrological alteration would result in a 30–40% loss of taxa in warmer, drier ecoregions and a 10–20% loss in cooler, wetter ecoregions (medium evidence, medium agreement ) (Pyne and Poff, 2017). In Africa’s Albertine Rift, 51% (n= 551) of fish are expected to be impacted by climate change, with 5.5% at a high risk due to their sensitivity and poor adaptative capability (medium evidence, high agreement ) (Carr et al., 2013)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.2.6_p6,China,"The impact of unsustainable land use on tropical forests continues in all regions (see Cross-Chapter Paper 7). Projected climate changes will not only impact biodiversity but also the livelihoods of affected people (robust evidence, high agreement ). Increased drought drives crop failures that cause local communities to expand their agricultural area by further clearing native forests (Desbureaux and Damania, 2018). Climate change is projected to enlarge the area of suitability for booming tree crops such as oil palm, acacia, Eucalyptus and rubber (Koninck et al., 2011; Cramb et al., 2015; Nath, 2016; Hurni et al., 2017; Li et al., 2017; Varkkey et al., 2018). An increase of 8% in the area of rubber plantations in Yunnan Province, China, between 2002–2010 to higher altitudes due to decreased environmental limits, has potentially increased pressure on the remaining biodiversity both within and outside of protected areas (Zomer et al., 2014a). As a consequence, the suitable area for mammals is projected to be reduced by 47.7% (RCP2.6) and 67.7% (RCP8.5) by 2070, with large variability depending on the different species (Cross-Chapter Paper 7) (Brodie, 2016). To minimize these potential threats, the Yunnan provincial government has identified suitable areas for the establishment of national parks, including the Asian Elephant National Park since 2006. And the government of China developed a national park system in 2013 across the country."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.3.1.2_p2,China;Canada;Indonesia;Mexico;Chile;Peru;Bolivia,"Projections indicate greater exposure of tropical rainforests, shrublands and grasslands, temperate conifer forests and grasslands, and tundra to novel climates (Hoffmann et al., 2019b; Elsen et al., 2020). A climate change scenario of ~3.5°C temperature increase by 2100 could expose 32% of the protected area in humid tropical forests (1.6 million km 2 in 2000) to climate that would be novel to humid tropical-forest protected areas; by 2050, the climate currently present in humid tropical-forest protected areas could disappear from 0.6 million km 2 (12% of the current total area) (Tabor et al., 2018). High rates of deforestation and climate change combined could expose 2% of the humid tropical-forest protected area (Tabor et al., 2018). Regional analyses under RCP8.5 also project the substantial disappearance of the current climate in protected areas in Bolivia, Chile and Peru (Fuentes-Castillo et al., 2020), Canada, Mexico and the USA (Batllori et al., 2017; Holsinger et al., 2019), China (Zomer et al., 2015), Europe (Nila et al., 2019) and Indonesia (Scriven et al., 2015). Projected climate change could expose an extensive part of the global protected area to disappearing and novel climate conditions (high confidence) (Cross-Chapter Paper 1)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.3.1_p2,China,"Historically, population and GDP have been growing over time. Scenario studies agree that further global population growth is likely up to 2050, leading to a range of possible outcomes of around 8.5–11 billion people (Figure 3.9a). After 2050, projections show a much wider range. If fertility drops below replacement levels, a decline in the global population is possible (as illustrated by SSP1 and SSP5). This typically includes scenarios with rapid development and investment in education. However, median projections mostly show a stabilisation of the world population (e.g., SSP2), while high-end projections show a continued growth (e.g., SSP3). The UN Population Prospects include considerably higher values for both the medium projection and the high end of the range than the SSP scenarios (KC and Lutz 2017; UN 2019). The most recent median UN projection reaches almost 11 billion people in 2100. The key differences are in Africa and China: here, the population projections are strongly influenced by the rate of fertility change (faster drop in SSPs). Underlying these differences, the UN approach is more based on current demographic trends while the SSPs assume a broader range of factors (including education) driving future fertility."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.5.2.2_p2,China;India,"A systematic map of the literature on carbon lock-in has synthesized quantification of stranded assets in the mitigation pathways literature, and showed that (i) coal power plants are the most exposed to risk of becoming stranded, (ii) delayed mitigation action increases stranded assets, and (iii) sectoral distribution and the amount of stranded assets differ between countries (Fisch-Romito et al. 2021). There is high agreement that existing fossil fuel infrastructure would need to be retired earlier than historically, used less, or retrofitted with CCS, to stay within the remaining carbon budgets of limiting warming to 1.5°C or 2°C (Johnson et al. 2016; Kefford et al. 2018; Pfeiffer et al. 2018; Cui et al. 2019; Fofrich et al. 2020; Rogelj et al. 2018 a). Studies estimate that cumulative early retired power plant capacities by 2060 can be up to 600 GW for gas and 1700 GW for coal (Iyer et al. 2015a; Kefford et al. 2018), that only 42% of the total capital stock of both operating and planned coal-fired powers plants can be utilised to be compatible with the 2°C target (Pfeiffer et al. 2018), and that coal-fired power plants in scenarios consistent with keeping global warming below 2°C or 1.5°C retire one to three decades earlier than historically has been the case (Cui et al. 2019; Fofrich et al. 2020). After coal, electricity production based on gas is also projected to be phased out, with some capacity remaining as back-up (van Soest et al. 2017a). Kefford et al. (2018) find USD541 billion worth of stranded fossil fuel power plants could be created by 2060, with China and India the most exposed."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.6.1.2_p3,China;India,"Regional policy costs depend on the evaluation framework (Budolfson et al. 2021), policy design, including revenue recycling, and on international coordination, especially among trade partners. By fostering technological change and finance, climate cooperation can generate economic benefits, both in large developing economies such as China and India (Paroussos et al. 2019) and industrialised regions such as Europe (Vrontisi et al. 2020). International coordination is a major driver of regional policy costs. Delayed participation in global mitigation efforts raises participation costs, especially in carbon-intensive economies (Figure 3.35a. Trading systems and transfers can deliver cost savings and improve equity (Rose et al. 2017a). On the other hand, measures that reduce imports of energy-intensive goods such as carbon-border tax adjustment may imply costs outside of the policy jurisdiction and have international equity repercussions, depending on how they are designed (Böhringer et al. 2012, 2017; Cosbey et al. 2019) (Section 13.6.6)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.7.4.1_p2,China;Canada,"The energy sector uses large volumes of water (Fricko et al. 2016), making it highly vulnerable to climate change (Tan and Zhi 2016) ( high confidence). Thermoelectric and hydropower sources are the most vulnerable to water stress (van Vliet et al. 2016). Restricted water supply to these power sources can affect grid security and affordable energy access (Koch et al. 2014; Ranzani et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2018d).The hydropower facilities from high mountain areas of Central Europe, Iceland, Western USA/Canada, and Latin America (Hock et al. 2019), as well as Africa and China (Bartos and Chester 2015; Gaupp et al. 2015; Tarroja et al. 2016; Conway et al. 2017; Byers et al. 2018; Eyer and Wichman 2018; Ranzani et al. 2018; Savelsberg et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2018d; Zhou et al. 2018; Wang et al. 2019) have experienced changes in seasonality and availability."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.7.5.2_p4,China;India;Brazil;Germany;South Africa;Indonesia;Nigeria,"The health co-benefits of the NDCs for 2040 were compared for two scenarios, one consistent with the goal of the Paris Agreement and the SDGs and the other also placing health as a central focus of the policies (i.e., health in all climate policies scenario) (Hamilton et al. 2021), for Brazil, China, Germany, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, South Africa, the UK, and the USA. Modelling of the energy, food and agriculture, and transport sectors, and associated risk factors related to mortality, suggested the sustainable pathways scenario could result in annual reductions of 1.18 million air pollution-related deaths, 5.86 million diet-related deaths, and 1.15 million deaths due to physical inactivity. Adopting the more ambitious health in all climate policies scenario could result in further reductions of 462,000 annual deaths attributable to air pollution, 572,000 annual deaths attributable to diet, and 943,000 annual deaths attributable to physical inactivity. These benefits were attributable to the mitigation of direct GHG emissions and the commensurate actions that reduce exposure to harmful pollutants, as well as improved diets and safe physical activity."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.1.5_p5,China;Malaysia,"When planning and implementing low-carbon transitions, it is important to consider the socio-economic context. An inclusive approach emphasises the need to engage non-state actors, including businesses, research organisations, non-profit organisations and citizens (Lee and Painter 2015; Hale et al. 2020). For example, engaging people in defining locally relevant mitigation targets and actions has enabled successful transformations in China (Engels 2018), Africa (Göpfert et al. 2019) and Malaysia (Ho et al. 2015). An active research and government collaboration through multiple stakeholder interactions in a large economic corridor in Malaysia led to the development and implementation of a low-carbon blueprint for the region (Ho et al. 2013). Many cities in LDCs and developing countries lack adequate urban infrastructure and housing. An equitable transformation in these cities entails prioritising energy access and basic services, including safe drinking water and sanitation, to meet basic needs of their populations."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.3.1_p10,China;India;United States;Japan;Australia,"A third trend in is urban land growth taking place on agricultural land, carbon stocks, and other land uses (see ‘carbon stock’ and ‘AFOLU’ – agriculture, forestry, and other land uses – in Glossary). As Figure 8.7 shows, over 60% of the reported urban expansion (nearly 40,000 km 2) from 1970 to 2010 was formerly agricultural land (Güneralp et al. 2020). This percentage increased to about 70% for global urban expansion that occurred between 1992 and 2015, followed by grasslands (about 12%) and forests (about 9%) (Liu et al. 2020a). In terms of percent of total urban land expansion, the largest conversion of agricultural lands to urban land uses from 1970 to 2010 took place in the Eastern Asia, and South-East Asia and Pacific regions; the largest proportional losses of natural land cover were reported for the North America and Australia, Japan and New Zealand regions (Güneralp et al. 2020). At a sub-regional level, agricultural land constituted the largest proportion of land converted to urban areas in China, India, Europe, Southeast Asian countries and the central United States between 1995 and 2015; in the eastern United States, most new urban land was converted from forests (Liu et al. 2020a). Urban expansion through 2040 may lead to the loss of almost 65 Mt of crop production – a scenario that underscores the ongoing relationship between urbanisation and AFOLU (van Vliet et al. 2017) (Chapter 7)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.3.4.1_p7,China;India;United States,"Second, there is a wide variation in estimates of urban land expansion across regions (using the AR6 WGIII 6-region aggregation). Across all four sets of forecasts, current urban land (circa 2015) is the largest in Developed Countries and in the Asia and Pacific region, with approximately two-thirds of the current urban extent occurring in those two regions (Table 8.1 and Figure 8.10). The largest increases in urban land by 2050 are expected in the Asia and Pacific and Developed Countries regions, across all the SSPs. However, the rate of increase in urban land in Eastern Europe and West-Central Asia, Latin America and Caribbean, and the Middle East is significant and urban land could more than double by 2050. One-third of the studies conclude that the United States, China, and India will experience continued urban land expansion at least until 2050 (Huang et al. 2019; Li et al. 2019b). However, Li et al. (2019) report that, after 2050, China could experience a decrease in the rate of urban land expansion, while growth will continue for India. This is not surprising since India’s urban demographic transition will only get underway after the middle of the century, when the urban population is expected to exceed the rural population. In contrast, China’s urban demographic transition could be nearly complete by 2050."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.3.4.1_p9,China,"Fourth, both the range of estimates and their implications on land-use competition and urban life point to an opportunity for urban areas to consider their urban form when developing. Under the current urbanisation trajectory, 50–63% of newly expanded urban areas are expected to occur on current croplands (Chen et al. 2020a). However, there is significant regional variation; between 2000 and 2040, 12.5% of cropland in China and 7.5% of cropland in the Middle East and North Africa could potentially be displaced due to urban expansion, compared to the world average of 3.7% (van Vliet et al. 2017). As urban clusters increase in size and greenspace is converted, future urban land expansion is expected to intensify UHIs and exacerbate night-time extreme temperatures. An urban footprint increase of 78–171% by 2050 over the urban footprint in 2015 is expected to result in average summer daytime and night-time warming in air temperature of 0.5°C–0.7°C, even up to about 3°C in certain locations (Huang et al. 2019). Furthermore, this urban expansion-induced warming is on average about half – and in certain locations nearly twice – as strong as warming that will be caused by GHG emissions based on the multi-model ensemble average forecasts in RCP4.5. In short, future urban expansion will amplify the background warming caused by GHG emissions, with extreme warming most pronounced during night-time (very high confidence) (Huang et al. 2019). These findings corroborate those in the Technical Summary of AR6 WGI (Arias et al. 2021)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.4.4.1_p3,China;United States;Germany;South Korea;Philippines;Spain,"Urban tree carbon storage is highly dependent on biome. For example, carbon sequestered by vegetation in Amazonian forests is two to five times higher compared to boreal and temperate forests (Blais et al. 2005). At the regional level, the estimated carbon storage density rates of tree cover include a range of 3.14–14.1 kgC m –2 in the United States, 3.85–5.58 kgC m –2 in South Korea, 1.53–9.67 kgC m –2 in Barcelona, Spain, 28.1–28.9 kgC m –2 in Leicester, England, and an estimated 6.82 kgC m –2 in Leipzig, Germany and 4.28 kgC m –2 in Hangzhou, China (Nowak et al. 2013). At the local scale, above- and below-ground tree carbon densities can vary substantially, as with carbon in soils and dead woody materials. The conservation of natural mangroves has been shown to provide urban mitigation benefits through carbon sequestration, as demonstrated in the Philippines (Abino et al. 2014). Research on urban carbon densities from the Southern Hemisphere will contribute to better estimates."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.4.4.2_p4,China;Portugal,"Providing a connected system of greenspace throughout the urban area may promote active transportation (Nieuwenhuijsen and Khreis 2016), thereby reducing GHG emissions. Soft solutions for improving green infrastructure connectivity for cycling is an urban NBS mitigation measure, although there is low evidence for emissions reductions. In the city of Lisbon, Portugal, improvements in cycling infrastructure and bike-sharing system resulted in 3.5 times more cyclists within two years (Félix et al. 2020). In Copenhagen, the cost of cycling (0.08 EUR km -1) is declining and is about six times lower than car driving (Euro 0.50/km) (Vedel et al. 2017). In addition, participants were willing to cycle 1.84 km longer if the route has a designated cycle track and 0.8 km more if there are also green surroundings. Changes in urban landscapes, including through the integration of green infrastructure in sustainable urban and transport planning, can support the transition from private motorised transportation to public and physically active transportation in carbon-neutral, more liveable and healthier cities (Nieuwenhuijsen and Khreis 2016; Nieuwenhuijsen 2020). Car infrastructure can be also transferred into public open and green space, such as in the Superblock model in Barcelona’s neighbourhoods (Rueda 2019). Health impact assessment models estimated that 681 premature deaths may be prevented annually with this implementation (Mueller et al. 2020) and the creation of greenways in Maanshan, China has stimulated interest in walking or cycling (Zhang et al. 2020)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.7.1_p5,China;United States,"At the global scale COVID-related lockdown and travel restrictions reduced daily CO2 emissions by –17% in early April 2020 compared to 2019 values (Le Quéré et al. 2020; Liu et al. 2020b), though subsequent studies have questioned the accuracy of the indirect proxy data used (Oda et al. 2021). Research at the national scale in the United States found that daily CO2 emissions declined –15% during the late March to early June time period (Gillingham et al. 2020). Research in China estimated that the first quarter of 2020 saw an 11.5% decline in CO2 emissions relative to 2019 (Zheng et al. 2020; Han et al. 2021). In Europe, estimates indicated a –12.5% decline in the first half of 2020 compared to 2019 (Andreoni 2021). Rebound to pre-COVID trajectories has been evidenced following the ease of travel restrictions (Le Quéré et al. 2021). It remains unclear to what extent COVID resulted in any structural change in the underlying drivers of urban emissions."

Wet regions, lowlands and floodplains will benefit from preventing construction in areas prone to landslides and flooding. Government and international aid are also important for improving people’s options to adapt and enhance their resilience to climate impacts. In northern Brazil, for example, government financial support has significantly reduced drought-related migration. There exists between Guatemala and Canada a temporary migration programme to bring in migrant workers during the harvest season. The United States is also increasing these types of legal temporary migration."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.5.2.2_p3,United States;Russia,"Some publications have suggested that stranded long-lived assets may be even more important outside of the power sector. While stranded power sector assets by 2050 could reach up to USD1.8 trillion in scenarios consistent with a 2°C target, Saygin et al. (2019) found a range of USD5–11 trillion in the buildings sector. Muldoon-Smith and Greenhalgh (2019) have even estimated a potential value at risk for global real estate assets up to USD21 trillion. More broadly, the set of economic activities that are potentially affected by a low-carbon transition is wide and includes also energy-intensive industries, transport and housing, as reflected in the concept of climate policy relevant sectors introduced in Battiston et al. (2017). The sectoral distribution and amount of stranded assets differ across countries (Fisch-Romito et al. 2021). Capital for fossil fuel production and distribution represents a larger share of potentially stranded assets in fossil fuel-producing countries such as the United States and Russia. Electricity generation would be a larger share of total stranded assets in emerging countries because this capital is relatively new compared to its operational lifetime. Conversely, buildings could represent a larger part of stranded capital in more developed countries and regions such as the USA, EU or even Russia because of high market value and low turnover rate."

The majority of cities that have experienced population declines are concentrated in Europe. Multiple factors contribute to the decline in cities, including declining industries and the economy, declining fertility, and outmigration to larger cities. Shrinking urban populations could offer retrofitting opportunities (UNEP 2019) and increasing greenspaces (Jarzebski et al. 2021), but the challenges for these cities differ in scope and magnitude from rapidly expanding cities."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.3.1_p8,United States;Australia,"An analysis of 478 cities with populations of more than 1 million people found that the predominant urban growth pattern worldwide is outward expansion, suggesting that cities are becoming more expansive than dense (Mahtta et al. 2019) (Figure 8.6). The study also found that cities within a geographic region exhibit remarkably similar patterns of urban growth. Some studies have found a mix of urban forms emerging around the world; an analysis of 194 cities identified an overall trend (from 1990 to 2015) toward urban forms that are a mixture of fragmented and compact (Lemoine-Rodriguez et al. 2020). The exception to this trend is a group of large cities in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States that are still predominantly fragmented. The same study also identified small to medium-sized cities as the most dynamic in terms of their expansion and change in their forms."

Maximum possible street tree planting among 245 world cities could reduce residential electricity use by about 0.9–4.8% annually (McDonald et al. 2016).

cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.5.2_p1,United States,"A significant research question that has been paid more attention in both the scientific and policy communities is related to subnational actors’ role in and contribution to global climate mitigation. The 2018 UN Environment Programme’s (UNEP) annual Emissions Gap report in 2018 included for the first time a special chapter on subnational and non-state (i.e., businesses and private) actors and assessed the landscape of studies aiming to quantify their contributions to global climate mitigation. Non-state action on net-zero GHG or CO2 emissions continues to be emphasised (UNEP 2021) (Box 8.4). There has been an increase in the number of studies aiming to quantify the overall aggregate mitigation impact of subnational climate action globally. Estimates for the significance of their impact vary widely, from up to 30 MtCO2-eq from 25 cities in the United States in 2030 (Roelfsema 2017), to a 2.3 GtCO2-eq reduction in 2030 compared to a current policy scenario from over 10,239 cities participating in GCoM (Hsu et al. 2018; GCoM 2019). For regional governments, the Under 2 Coalition, which includes 260 governments pledging goals to keep global temperature rise below 2°C, is estimated to reduce emissions by 4.2 GtCO2-eq in 2030, compared to a current policy scenario (Kuramochi et al. 2020)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.5.2_p2,United States,"Some studies suggest that subnational mitigation actions (Roelfsema 2017; Kuramochi et al. 2020) are in addition to national government mitigation efforts and can therefore reduce emissions even beyond current national policies, helping to ‘bridge the gap’ between emissions trajectories consistent with least-cost scenarios for limiting temperature rise below 1.5°C or 2°C (Blok et al. 2012). In some countries, such as the United States, where national climate policies have been curtailed, the potential for cities’ and regions’ emissions reduction pledges to make up the country’s Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement is assessed to be significant (Kuramochi et al. 2020)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.7.1_p4,United States,"Though preliminary, some studies suggest that urban areas saw larger overall declines in emissions because of lower commuter activity and associated emissions. For example, researchers have explored the COVID-19 impact in the cities of Los Angeles, Baltimore, Washington, DC, and San Francisco Bay Area in the United States. In the San Francisco region, a decline of 30% in anthropogenic CO2 was observed, which was primarily due to changes in on-road traffic (Turner et al. 2020). Declines in the Washington, DC/Baltimore region and in the Los Angeles urban area were 33% and 34%, respectively, in the month of April 2020 compared to previous years (Yadav et al. 2021)."

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.3.3.3_p1,Brazil;Australia,"Analysis of river flows from 7250 observatories around the world covering the years 1971–2010 and identified spatially complex patterns, with reductions in northeastern Brazil, southern Australia and the Mediterranean, and increases in northern Europe (medium evidence, medium agreement ) (Gudmundsson et al., 2021). More than half of global rivers undergo periodic drying that reduces river connectivity (medium evidence, medium agreement ). Increased frequency and intensity of droughts may cause perennial rivers to become intermittent and intermittent rivers to disappear (medium evidence, medium agreement ), threatening freshwater fish in habitats already characterised by heat and droughts (Datry et al., 2016; Schneider et al., 2017; Jaric et al., 2019). In high-altitude/latitude streams, reduced glacier and snowpack extent, earlier snowmelt and altered precipitation patterns, attributed to climate change, have increased flow intermittency (Siebers et al., 2019; Gudmundsson et al., 2021). Patterns in flow regimes can be directly linked to a variety of processes shaping freshwater biodiversity, so any climate change-induced changes in flow regimes and river connectivity are expected to alter species composition as well as having societal impacts (See Chapter 3 in (IPCC, 2018b)) (Bunn and Arthington, 2002; Thomson et al., 2012; Chessman, 2015; Kakouei et al., 2018)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.4.2.3_p2,Brazil,"In the Amazon, deforestation for agricultural expansion and the degradation of forests adjacent to deforested areas cause wildfire in moist humid tropical forests not adapted to fire (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Fonseca et al., 2017; van Marle et al., 2017; da Silva et al., 2018 ; da Silva et al., 2021; dos Reis et al., 2021; Libonati et al., 2021). Roads facilitate deforestation, fragmenting the rainforest and increasing the dryness and flammability of vegetation (Alencar et al., 2015). Extreme droughts that occur during warm phases of the ENSO and the Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation combine with the degradation of vegetation to cause extreme fire events (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Fonseca et al., 2017; Aragao et al., 2018; da Silva et al., 2018 ; Burton et al., 2020; dos Reis et al., 2021; Libonati et al., 2021). In the State of Roraima, Brazil, distance to roads and infrastructure that enable deforestation and ENSO were the factors most explaining fire occurrence in the extreme 2015–2016 fire season (Fonseca et al., 2017). From 1973 to 2014, burned area increased in the Amazon, coinciding with increased deforestation (van Marle et al., 2017). In the State of Acre, Brazil, burned area increased 36-fold from 1984 to 2016, with 43% burned in agricultural and livestock settlement areas (da Silva et al., 2018 ). In the extreme fire year 2019, 85% of the area burned in the Amazon occurred in areas deforested in 2018 (Cardil et al., 2020). Even though relatively higher moisture in 2019 led to burning below the 2002–2019 average across most of South America, burning in areas of recent deforestation in the Amazon were above the 2002–2019 average, indicating that deforestation, not meteorological conditions, triggered the 2019 fires (Kelley et al., 2021; Libonati et al., 2021). Furthermore, from 1981 to 2018, deforestation in the Amazon reduced moisture inputs to the lower atmosphere, increasing drought and fire in a self-reinforcing feedback (Xu et al., 2020). In the Amazon, deforestation exerts an influence on wildfire that can be stronger than climate change (robust evidence, high agreement )."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.4.4.3_p1,Brazil;Indonesia,"High biodiversity and ecosystem carbon generally occur together, with rainforests in the Amazon, Congo and Indonesia containing the largest above-ground vegetation carbon stocks (Saatchi et al., 2011; Baccini et al., 2012; Avitabile et al., 2016) and the highest vascular plant species richness (Kreft and Jetz, 2007) in the world. Above-ground ecosystem carbon and animal species richness show high correlation but also high spatial variability (Strassburg et al., 2010). Above-ground carbon is correlated to genus richness globally (Cavanaugh et al., 2014), but to species richness only in local areas (Poorter et al., 2015; Sullivan et al., 2017). Species richness generally increases vegetation productivity in the humid tropics while tree abundance increases productivity in drier conditions (Madrigal-Gonzalez et al., 2020). Across the Amazon, ~1% of tree species contain 50% of the above-ground carbon, due to abundance and maximum height (Fauset et al., 2015). Above-ground carbon in tropical forests shows positive correlations to vertebrate species richness (P values not reported) (Deere et al., 2018; Di Marco et al., 2018). In logged and burned tropical forest in Brazil, species richness of plants, birds and beetles increased with carbon density up to ~100 tonnes ha -1 (Ferreira et al., 2018)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.2.6_p1,Brazil,"Key factors affecting the future distribution of tropical humid and dry forests are amounts and seasonalities of precipitation, increased temperatures, prolonged droughts and droughted-moderated fires (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Bonai et al., 2016; Corlett, 2016; Lyra et al., 2017; Anderson et al., 2018; da Silva et al., 2018 ; Fontes et al., 2018; O’Connell et al., 2018; Aguirre-Gutiérrez et al., 2019; Bartlett et al., 2019; Brando et al., 2019; Stan and Sanchez-Azofeifa, 2019). The probability of severe drought is projected to quadruple in natural areas in Brazil with >2°C warming (Barbosa and Lakshmi Kumar, 2016; Marengo et al., 2020). Most multi-model studies assuming rapid economic growth/business-as-usual scenarios (A2, A1B and RCP8.5) show an increase in future woody biomass and areas of woody cover towards the end of the 21st century in temperate regions (Boit et al., 2016; Nabuurs et al., 2017) and tropical forests in East Africa (Ross et al., 2021) but a decrease in the remaining tropical regions (Anadón et al., 2014a; Boit et al., 2016; Lyra et al., 2017; Nabuurs et al., 2017; Maia et al., 2020). Terrestrial species are predicted to shift to cooler temperatures and higher elevations (Pecl et al., 2017). Tropical species are more susceptible to climate warming than temperate species (Rehm and Feeley, 2016; Sentinella et al., 2020). This susceptibility will be exacerbated by road-building increasing the ease of access into forests (Brinck et al., 2017; Taubert et al., 2018; Bovendorp et al., 2019; Senior et al., 2019). Furthermore, most tropical cloud forest species are unable to invade grasslands and this will increase the risk of extinctions in tropical cloud forests (Rehm and Feeley, 2015)."

Other species and vegetation types at risk from the partial disappearance of suitable climate in protected areas include Atlantic Forest amphibians in Brazil (Lemes et al., 2014), birds in Finland (Virkkala et al., 2013), birds and trees in Canada and Mexico (Stralberg et al., 2020), bog woodlands in Germany (Steinacker et al., 2019), butterflies and mammals in Egypt (Leach et al., 2013) and tropical dry forests in Mexico (Prieto-Torres et al., 2016).

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.3.6.1_p2,Brazil,"Diminished vegetation cover following wildfires (Section 2.5.3.2) and tree mortality (Section 2.5.3.3) can reduce long-term water infiltration, increase soil erosion and flash floods and release sediment that degrades drinking water quality. Widlfires increase impacts of extreme precipitation events due to climate change, which contribute to increased surface runoff and hence increased risks of land erosion, landslides and flooding (Ebel et al., 2012; Robinne et al., 2020). Under current conditions, nearly half the global land area is at a moderate-to-high risk of water scarcity due to wildfires (Robinne et al., 2018; Robinne et al., 2020). From 1984 to 2014, wildfires in the western USA affected 6–11% of stream and river length (Ball et al., 2021). Under a high-emissions scenario of a 3.5°C temperature increase, post-fire erosion across the western USA could double sedimentation and degrade drinking water quality in one-third of watersheds by 2050 (Sankey et al., 2017). In Brazil, post-fire vegetation loss tends to increase runoff, reduce infiltration and reduce groundwater recharge and flow of springs (Rodrigues et al., 2019). Runoff from wildfires can contain DOC precursors for the formation of carcinogenic trihalomethanes during chlorination of water for drinking (Uzun et al., 2020) as well as chromium, mercury, selenium and other toxic trace metals (Burton et al., 2016; Burton et al., 2019)."

In southern Thailand, the combination of the conversion of forest to rubber plantations and a one-third increase in rainfall could increase erosion and sediment load by 15% (Trisurat et al., 2016). In the watershed that supplies São Paulo, Brazil, afforestation could increase water quantity and quality (Ferreira et al., 2019). In most regions with dry or Mediterranean subtropical climates, projected climate change can reduce surface water and groundwater resources (Doell et al., 2015). In northeast Spain, reduced precipitation and vegetation cover under the high-emissions scenario of a 3.5°C temperature increase could reduce drinking water supplies by half by 2100 (Bangash et al., 2013)."

(2013) analysed 94 restoration projects globally and found costs varied by several orders of magnitude, but in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems mostly in the range of USD 100–10,000 per hectare. They did, however, estimate that the majority of these projects provided net benefits and should be considered as high-yield investments. Some methods can be much cheaper than others, even in the same type of ecosystems in the same country; the estimated cost of restoring forest cover in Brazil varied between a mean of USD 49 using natural regeneration compared to a mean of USD 2041 per hectare using planting (Brancalion et al., 2019). When assessing costs, it is also important to take into account the benefits delivered by different options, both in economic terms and regarding other wider benefits."

Significant dependency on rainfed agriculture (>30% in Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua) indicates high sensitivity to climatic variability and change and represents a challenge for food security (high confidence) (SRCCL Chapter 5, Mbow et al., 2019). Undernutrition has worsened since 2014 in CSA (SRCCL Chapter 5, Mbow et al., 2019). Evidence of climate-change impacts on food security is emerging from IKLK studies in SA. Municipalities in CA with a high proportion of subsistence crops tend to have fewer resources for adaptation and more vulnerable to climate change (SRCCL Chapter 5, Mbow et al., 2019). Rising temperature and decreased rainfall could reduce agricultural productivity by 2030, threatening the food security of the poorest populations (WGII AR5 Chapter 27, Magrin et al., 2014). Though reduced suitability and yield for beans, coffee, maize, plantain and rice are expected in CA (SRCCL Chapter 5, Mbow et al., 2019), limiting the warming to 1.5°C, compared with 2°C, are projected to result in smaller net reductions in yields of maize, rice, wheat and other cereal crops for CSA (high confidence) (SR15 Chapter 3, Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018). The heat stress is expected to reduce the suitability of Arabica coffee in Mesoamerica, but it can improve in high-latitude areas in SA (SRCCL Chapter 4, Olsson et al., 2019). There is limited evidence that these declines in crop yields may result in significant population displacement from the tropics to the sub-tropics (SR15 Chapter 3, Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018)."

Losses of biomass as high as 40% are projected in CA with a warming of 3°C–4°C, and the Amazon may experience a significant dieback at similar warming levels (SR15 Chapter 3, Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018). Advances in second-generation bioethanol from sugarcane and other feedstock will be important for mitigation. However, agricultural expansion results in large conversions in tropical dry woodlands and savannahs in SA (Brazilian Cerrado, Caatinga and Chaco) (high confidence) (SRCCL Chapter 1, Arneth et al., 2019). The expansion of soybean plantations in the Amazonian state of Mato Grosso in Brazil reached 16.8% yr −1 from 2000 to 2005; and oil palm, a significant biofuel crop, is also linked to recent deforestation in tropical CA (Costa Rica and Honduras) and SA (Colombia and Ecuador), although lower in magnitude compared to deforestation from soybean and cattle ranching (WGII AR5 Chapter 27, Magrin et al., 2014)."

Changes in the dry season in the central part of South America (SA) due to the late onset and late retreat of monsoon, decreases in precipitation over the Amazon and central Brazil are expected (Coppola et al., 2014; Giorgi et al., 2014; Llopart et al., 2014). Further, an increase in the frequency and geographic extent of meteorological drought in the eastern Amazon and the opposite in the west are expected with medium confidence (Duffy et al., 2015). A decrease in the total annual precipitation but an increase in heavy precipitation (Seiler et al., 2013; Chou et al., 2014) are projected for a 2°C GWL (Figure 12.6; WGI AR6 Table 11.15) (Seneviratne et al., 2021)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.3.4.2_p2,Brazil,"It is not surprising, therefore, that while SAM is the region in CSA that experienced the highest temperature increase in the last century, it is where most of the fire spots in the sub-continent are located, owing also to the prevalent use of fires in pasturelands (medium confidence: medium evidence, high agreement ) (Bowman et al., 2009). Recently, da Silva Junior et al. (2020) reported 6,708,350 and 6,188,606 fire foci in Cerrado and Amazonia, between 1999 and 2018, corresponding to 80% of the total observed in Brazil. The occurrence of extreme droughts has affected the carbon and water cycles in large areas of the Amazon rainforest (high confidence) (Lapola et al., 2014; Agudelo et al., 2019), in particular in its southern and eastern portions, where deforestation rates are higher. The loss of carbon in the Amazon region considering the combined effect of land use change in the southern portion of the region bordering Cerrado and Pantanal and global carbon emission scenarios can be as high as 38% at 4°C of warming, but limited to 8% if the Paris Agreement limit of 1.5°C is achieved (medium confidence, medium evidence, high agreement ) (Burton et al., 2021), driving the region to be a net carbon source to the atmosphere (Gatti et al., 2021). A recent extreme drought was estimated to affect the photosynthetic capacity of 400,000 km 2 of the forest (Anderson et al., 2018b); nevertheless, there are considerable uncertainties regarding the effects of CO2 fertilisation in tropical forests and ecosystems (medium confidence: medium evidence, high agreement ) (Sampaio et al., 2021). Extreme drought events increase forest vulnerability to fire, directly affecting the biodiversity and the forest structure and its plant species distribution (high agreement ) (Brando et al., 2014). Production sectors are also exposed. SAM is pointed out as a region where agricultural production will be especially impacted by climate change, affecting the production of annual crops, fruits and livestock (medium confidence: medium evidence, high agreement ) (Lapola et al., 2014; Zilli et al., 2020)."

The Brazilian Cerrado is one of the most diverse savannah in the world, with more than 12,600 plant species, with 35% being endemic (high confidence) (Forzza et al., 2012). Historic land cover change and concurrent climate change in the region strongly impacted the biodiversity and led to the extinction of 657 plant species for the Cerrado, which is more than four times the global recorded plant extinctions (high confidence) (Strassburg et al., 2017; Green et al., 2019). The effects of climate change, expressed by drought and heatwaves, lead to plant stress, compromising growth and increasing mortality (Yu et al., 2019). The fauna dependent on dew water was strongly impacted by the 1.6°C temperature rise that occurred from 1961 to 2019 (medium confidence: medium evidence, medium agreement ) (Hofmann et al., 2021). Modelling outcomes project impacts in forest ecosystems in the region, with persistent warming and significant moisture reduction (Anjos et al., 2021), leading to a potential change in the ecosystem structure and distribution in the region (medium confidence: medium evidence, medium agreement ) (Government of Brazil, 2020)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.3.4.4_p3,Brazil,"SAM hosts the headwaters of important South American rivers, such as the Paraguay, Madeira, Tocantins-Araguaia and Xingu. The impact from climate change is expressed differently in several sub-regions. Extreme floods in the southern Amazon and Bolivian Amazon floodplains were described and related to the exceptionally warm sub-tropical South Atlantic ocean (high confidence) (Espinoza et al., 2014), causing high economic impacts (losses in crop and livestock production and infrastructure) and number of fatalities (very high confidence)  (Ovando et al., 2016). In contrast, declines in stream flow, particularly in the dry season, expressed by the ratio of runoff to rainfall, are observed for the southern part of the Amazon basin (high evidence) (Molina-Carpio et al., 2017; Espinoza et al., 2019b; Heerspink et al., 2020). Observed precipitation reduction in the Cerrado region impacted main water supply reservoirs for important cities in the Brazilian central region, leading to a water crisis in 2016/2017 (Government of Brazil, 2020) and affecting hydropower energy generation (Ribeiro Neto et al., 2016). Modelling studies project decreases in the river discharge rate on the order of 27% for the Tapajós basin and 53% for the Tocantins-Araguaia basin for the end of the century, which may affect freshwater biodiversity, navigation and generation of hydroelectric power (medium confidence: medium evidence, high agreement ) (Marcovitch et al., 2010; Mohor et al., 2015). This region also holds one of the largest floodplains in the world, the Pantanal. The climatic connection of Pantanal regions to the Amazon, and the influence of deforestation in local precipitation (Marengo et al., 2018) has implications for conservation of ecosystem services and water security in Pantanal (high confidence) (Bergier et al., 2018). Impacts of extreme drought, with increasing numbers of dry days and the peak of fire foci, were recently reported (robust evidence) (Lázaro et al., 2020; Garcia et al., 2021).

It is estimated that more than 10 million people are exposed to forest fires in the deforestation arc, a region comprising several Brazilian states in the southern and western parts of the Amazon rainforest, with several impacts on human health including potential exacerbation of the COVID-19 crisis in Amazonia (medium confidence: medium evidence, high agreement ) (de Oliveira et al., 2020) (Table 12.5). Increases in hospital admissions, asthma, DNA damage and lung cell death due to the inhalation of fine particulate matter  represent an increase in public health system costs (high confidence) (Ignotti et al., 2010; Silva et al., 2013; de Oliveira Alves et al., 2017; Machin et al., 2019). The patchy landscape created by forest clearing contributes to a rising risk of zoonotic disease emergence by increasing interactions between wildlife, livestock and humans (medium confidence: low evidence, medium agreement ) (Dobson et al., 2020; Tollefson, 2020). Recent studies also suggest an influence of climate change in zoonotic diseases, such as Orthohantavirus and Chapare viral infections, rodent-borne diseases, in some areas of Bolivia (Escalera-Antezana et al., 2020a; Escalera-Antezana et al., 2020b). Extreme fluctuations in Amazon River levels were associated with a significant increase in the incidence of diarrhoea, leptospirosis and dermatitis (de Souza Hacon et al., 2019; Government of Brazil, 2020). According to a comprehensive characterisation of future heatwaves and alternative RCPs scenarios, Brazilian urban areas in the SAM region are projected to face increasing related mortality from 400% to 500% in the period 2031–2080 compared to the period 1971–2020, under the highest emission scenario and high-variant population scenario (medium confidence: low evidence, medium agreement ) (Guo et al., 2018).

The rural population already suffers from natural water scarcity in the countryside. The drought in 2012 was responsible for reducing up to 99% of the corn production in Pernambuco state (Government of Brazil, 2020). A predicted increase in drought, coupled with inadequate soil management practices by small farmers and agribusiness, increases the region’s susceptibility to desertification (Spinoni et al., 2015; Vieira et al., 2015; Mariano et al., 2018; Tomasella et al., 2018; Marengo et al., 2020c). In NES, 70,000 km 2 have reached a point at which agriculture is no longer possible (Government of Brazil, 2020). Intense droughts have triggered migration to urban centres within and outside NES (Confalonieri et al., 2014a; Government of Brazil, 2020). More than 10 million people have been impacted by the drought of 2012/2014 in the region, which was responsible for water shortage and contamination, increasing death by diarrhoea (Marengo and Bernasconi, 2015; Government of Brazil, 2020)."

NES concentrates the bulk of the predicted loss of regional gross domestic product (GDP) associated with agriculture in Brazil (Ferreira Filho and Moraes, 2015; Forcella et al., 2015). Although agriculture makes a modest contribution to the region’s economy, its drop could have a severe impact on the poorest rural household by shrinking the agricultural labour market and increasing food prices (Ferreira Filho and Moraes, 2015; Government of Brazil, 2020). The expected increase in dryness is also predicted to impact the region’s hydroelectric power generation (Marengo et al., 2017; de Jong et al., 2018). SLR has also been reported to impact coastal cities such as Salvador, destroying urban constructions (Government of Brazil, 2020). SLR, increased ocean temperature and acidification may also negatively impact NES’s shrimp aquaculture production (Figure 12.8) (Gasalla et al., 2017).

An increasing number of studies show that the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado are at risk of biodiversity loss, largely due to projected reductions of species’ geographic distributions in many different taxa (e.g., Loyola et al. 2012, 2014; Ferro et al. 2014; Hoffmann et al. 2015; Martins et al. 2015; Aguiar et al. 2016b; Vale et al. 2018; Borges et al. 2019; Braz et al. 2019; Vale et al. 2021). Cerrado savannahs are projected to be the hotspot most negatively impacted by climate change within SA, mostly though range contraction of plant species (very high confidence), while the Atlantic Forest is projected to be highly impacted especially though the contraction of the distribution of endemic species (very likely ) (Section CCP1.2.2; Figure 12.10) (Manes et al., 2021). Reductions in species’ distribution are also projected in the River Plate basin for sub-tropical amphibians (Schivo et al., 2019) and the river tiger (Salminus brasiliensis), a keystone fish of economic value (Ruaro et al., 2019). Farming of mussels and oysters in the region is predicted to be negatively impacted by climate change, particularly SLR, and ocean warming and acidification (Gasalla et al., 2017). Some more localised habitats are also at risk of losing area due to climate change, such as the meadows of northwestern Patagonia (Crego et al., 2014) and mangroves of southern Brazil (Godoy and Lacerda, 2015).

Almost two-thirds of soy consumed in EU+ comes from Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay (IDH, 2020), increasing conversion risk in the Amazon, Cerrado and Gran Chaco. Despite growing commodity production traceability, in 2018 only 19% of the soybean meal consumed in EU+ was certified deforestation-free and 38% compliant with the FEFAC Soy Sourcing Guidelines (IDH, 2020), which poses a serious challenge at the international level (Negra et al., 2014; Curtis et al., 2018; Lambin et al., 2018; IDH, 2020)."

Existing proposed measures, instruments and programmes, however, do not yet reflect the vision needed to integrate the ecosystem and human dimensions of vulnerability. Administration coordination and the progress in adaptive ecosystem management are still in their early stages, due in part to the lack of stable financial resources and scientific knowledge and IKLK about adapting ecosystems to climate change (Bustamante et al., 2020). Brazil was an exception, showing dramatic policy-driven reduction in deforestation in the Amazon between 2004–2012, with a concomitant 70% increase in soy production, the most profitable Amazon crop (Hansen et al., 2013; Nepstad et al., 2014). Policies included territorial planning (protected areas, Indigenous territories and land tenure), satellite monitoring and market and credit restrictions on high-deforesting municipalities, plus some incentives to small farmers (Boucher et al., 2013; Hansen et al., 2013; Nepstad et al., 2014; Castelo, 2015; Cunha et al., 2016a). It is important to highlight the important role of Indigenous territories, in addition to protected areas, in forest conservation in the Amazon (high evidence, medium agreement ) (Schwartzman et al., 2013; Barber et al., 2014; Nepstad et al., 2014; Walker et al., 2014b). These policies were partially funded by results-based compensation through the Amazon Fund. Since 2012, however, policies and institutions have weakened, and Amazon deforestation rates have started to rise (Carvalho et al., 2019), becoming more acute in recent years (Silva Junior et al., 2021). Conservation incentives, a new complementary and allegedly cost-effective approach, is increasingly being implemented in the region (Magrin et al., 2014). They include PES, REDD+, environmental certification and conservation easements, but remain controversial, and more research is needed on their effectiveness, possible negative side effects, participatory management systems and collective decision-making processes (Larson and Petkova, 2011; Locatelli et al., 2011; Pinho et al., 2014; Strassburg et al., 2014; Mistry et al., 2016; Gebara and Agrawal, 2017; Scarano et al., 2018; Ruggiero et al., 2019; To and Dressler, 2019; Vallet et al., 2019)."

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.3.1_p1,Brazil;Chile;Peru;Argentina,"In several regions of CSA, water scarcity is a serious challenge to local livelihoods and economic activities. Regions that are (seasonally) dry, partly with large populations and increasing water demand, exhibit particularly significant water stress. These include the Dry Corridor in CA, coastal areas of Peru (SWS) and northern Chile (SWS), the Bolivian-Peruvian Altiplano (NWS, SAM), the Dry Andes of Central Chile (SWS), Western Argentina and Chaco in northwestern Paraguay (SES) and Sertão in northeastern Brazil (NES) (high confidence) (Kummu et al., 2016; Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2016; Schoolmeester et al., 2018). In NWS and SWS, downstream areas are increasingly affected by decreasing and unreliable river runoff due to rapid glacier shrinkage (high confidence) (Table SM12.6; Carey et al., 2014; Drenkhan et al., 2015; Buytaert et al., 2017). Many regions in CSA rely heavily on hydroelectric energy, and as a result of rising energy demand, hydropower capacity is constantly being extended (Schoolmeester et al., 2018). Worldwide, SA features the second-fastest growth rate, with about 5.2 GW additional annual capacity installed in 2019 (IHA, 2020). This development requires additional water storage options, which entail the construction of large dams and reservoirs with important social-ecological implications. River fragmentation and corresponding loss of habitat connectivity due to dam constructions have been described for, for example, the NSA, SAM, NES and SES (high confidence) (Grill et al., 2015; Anderson et al., 2018a),  with important implications for freshwater biota, such as fish migration (medium confidence) (Pelicice et al., 2015; Herrera-R et al., 2020). Furthermore, examples in, for instance, NWS (Carey et al., 2012; Duarte-Abadía et al., 2015; Hommes and Boelens, 2018) and SWS (Muñoz et al., 2019b) showcase unresolved water-related conflicts between local villagers, peasant communities, hydropower operators and governmental institutions in a context of distrust and lack of water governance (high confidence)."

In turn, inclusive water regimes leverage long-term adaptation planning. These have been addressed in some national strategies, such as in Brazil (Ministry of Environment of Brazil, 2016a). At the local level, a decentralised and participatory bottom-up water governance model was induced by civil society and research institutions to foster rainwater harvesting technologies reducing drought risk in semiarid Brazil (NES) (Lindoso et al., 2018)."

Costa Rica offers an example on how reforestation can help achieve Paris Agreement objectives. Reforestation through natural regeneration on abandoned pastures boosted forest cover from 48% in 2005 to 53.4% in 2010 (Reid et al., 2019; Cárdenas et al., 2021). Some key success factors included a strong institutional context, fiscal and financial incentives for reforestation, conservation measures such as payment for environmental services, cattle ranch subsidy reform and a historically strong enforcement and focus on land titles that favoured the restoration of lands. Uruguay offers another example, with the farm sector contribution of 32.8% of all exports and 73.8% of the country’s emissions, so decarbonisation is not just an environmental issue but an economic competitiveness one as well. In the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) submitted to the UNFCCC in 2015, Uruguay set a specific target for the agriculture sector to reduce enteric methane emissions intensity per kilogram of beef (live weight) by 33% to 46% in 2030 by improving efficiency of beef production by controlling the grazing intensity to increase animal intake, reproductive efficiency and daily weight gain (Picasso et al., 2014)."

Such services should address the challenges of ensuring that climate information and advisory services are relevant to the decisions of smallholder and family farmers, providing timely climate service access to remote rural communities with marginal infrastructure and ensuring that farmers own climate services and shape their design and delivery. An interesting case facing this gap is the implementation of local technical agro-climatic committees in Colombia, which make it possible to share and validate climatic and weather forecasts, as well as crop model results for seasonal drought events (Loboguerrero et al., 2018). Another example is the web service AdaptaBrasil-MCTI, which forecasts the risk of climate-change impacts on strategic sectors (e.g., food, energy, water) in Brazil (Government of Brazil and Ministry of Science Technology and Innovation Secretariat of Policies and Programs, 2021)."

In 2014, the penetration rate of this type of insurance in the region averaged 0.03% of GDP, and a few countries dominate the market (Brazil, Argentina). Beyond these countries, some initiatives also exist in Uruguay, Paraguay, Chile and Ecuador. In most Latin American and Caribbean countries, the public sector plays an important role in providing insurance or reinsurance and coexists with private-sector companies (Cárdenas et al., 2021). Insurance protections represent a strategy to transfer climate risk to protect the well-being of vulnerable small farmers and accelerate uptake (recovery) after a climate-related extreme weather event. Lack of finance and proper infrastructure is compounded by limited knowledge of sustainable farming practices and high rates of financial illiteracy (high confidence) (Hurlbert and Gupta, 2017; Piggott-McKellar et al., 2019)."

Agricultural technologies are not necessarily changing, but the economic activity is shifting to accommodate increasing climate variation and adapt to changes in water availability and ideal growing conditions (high confidence), as is observed in Argentina, Colombia and Brazil (McMartin et al., 2018; Rolla et al., 2018; Sloat et al., 2020; Gori Maia et al., 2021). Coffee plantations are moving further up mountain regions, with the land at lower elevations converted for other uses. In Brazil, crop modelling suggests the need for the development of new cultivars, with a longer crop cycle and with higher tolerance to high temperatures, a necessary technological advance for maize, an essential staple crop, to be produced in the future.

The importance of this sub-sector in CSA will continue to increase as the demand for meat products does as well in the coming years, driven by growing incomes in the region (OECD and FAO, 2019). However, the increase in animal production has been associated with land degradation, triggered by the conversion of native vegetation to pastureland and aggravated by overgrazing and abandoning of the degraded pastures (Baumann et al., 2017; ECLAC, 2018; Müller-Hansen et al., 2019). Sá et al. (2017) simulated the adoption of agricultural systems based on LCA strategies towards 2050. According to the simulation, the adoption of LCA strategies in the SA region can alter the growing trend of land use and land use change emissions, and at the same time, it can increase meat production by 55 Mt for the entire period (2016–2050). The restoration of degraded pasture and livestock intensification account for 71.2% and integrated crop–livestock–forestry system contributes 28.8% of total meat production for the entire period. These results indicate that combined actions in agricultural management systems in SA can result in synergistic responses that can be used to make agriculture and livestock production an important part of the solution of global climate change and advance food security (medium confidence: insufficient evidence and high agreement ) (Zu Ermgassen et al., 2018; Pompeu et al., 2021). Crop–livestock–forestry systems are also important for climate-change adaptation as they provide multiple benefits, including the coproduction of food, animal feed, organic fertilizers and soil organic carbon sequestration (Sharma et al., 2016; Rodríguez et al., 2021), achieving mitigation and adaptation goals (high confidence) (Picasso et al., 2014; Modernel et al., 2016, 2019; Rolla et al., 2019; Locatelli et al., 2020). A recent analysis of agroforestry in Brazil showed positive and relevant impacts on the heads/pasture area rate in livestock production and that the system may have also stimulated a shift towards other production activities with higher gross added value (Gori Maia et al., 2021). Agroforestry has also proven to have protective benefits to obtain more stable, less fluctuating yields due to climate-related damage in coffee production (high confidence) (Bacon et al., 2017; Durand-Bessart et al., 2020; Ovalle-Rivera et al., 2020). In the same way, the production of plant-based fibre can be less vulnerable to economic and climatic variability through farming system diversification. Textile fibre crops for the case of cotton include crop rotation, agroecological intercropping and agroforestry (Oliveira Duarte et al., 2019)."

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.6.3_p2,Brazil;Ecuador;Colombia,"Vulnerability and risk maps for climate disasters have been developed at the city level, for example in Bogota, Cartagena de Indias and Mocoa in Colombia (Yamin et al., 2013; Guzman Torres and Barrera Arciniegas, 2014; Tehelen and Pacha, 2017; Zamora, 2018), and for the metropolitan district of Quito in Ecuador (Tehelen and Pacha, 2017). In addition, vulnerability maps were created for the primary road network of Colombia (Tehelen and Pacha, 2017). At the regional level, vulnerability maps using climate-change probability, disaster risk and food insecurity variables have been produced for the Andean region (WFP, 2014). In Brazil, vulnerability maps that consider exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity, coupled with climate scenarios, were designed to support the NAP on a municipal scale (Chang and Garcia, 2018; Duval et al., 2018; Marinho and Silva, 2018; Menezes, 2018; Santos and Marinho, 2018; Silva et al., 2018). A Climate Change Vulnerability Index was used to generate vulnerability maps for countries of the Latin American and Caribbean region (Vörösmarty et al., 2013; CAF, 2014)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.6.4_p5,Brazil;Colombia;Bolivia,"Adaptation strategies implemented by the public sector include a diverse suite of strategies ranging from the creation of green spaces in urban areas, relocation of families located in disaster-prone areas, ecosystem restoration and improved access to clean water, among many others (high confidence) (Table 12.9). Building GGI has been a popular public adaptation measure to reduce deaths and injuries because of floods (Section 12.5.5.3.2). Infrastructure has been improved at schools, public buildings and drainage systems in cities such as Bogota, Colombia (World Bank, 2014) and La Paz, Bolivia (Fernández and Buss, 2016). In Brazil, channel works were implemented to reduce the flooding of the Tiete River, which crosses the metropolitan area of São Paulo; these projects were designed based on simulated flood scenarios (Hori et al., 2017)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.6.4_p6,Brazil;Colombia,"Another example of a public adaptation measure is the protection and restoration of natural areas, which have the potential to decrease the transmission of water- and vector-borne infectious diseases (medium confidence: robust evidence, low agreement ). Studies have shown that these measures can diminish the cases of malaria and diarrhoea in Brazil and cases of diarrhoea in children in Colombia (Bauch et al., 2015; Herrera et al., 2017; Chaves et al., 2018). However, deforestation and malaria have a complex relationship that relies on local context interactions, where land use and land cover changes play an important role due to vector ecology alterations and social conditions of human settlements (Rubio-Palis et al., 2013). Forest conservation can improve hydrological cycle control and soil erosion that can help to improve water quality and reduce the burden of water-borne diseases. In addition, forest cover can help to diminish the habitat for larval mosquitoes that transmit malaria. These measures can help to design policies at sites where these problems do not currently exist but can emerge as a consequence of climate change and the increase in the frequency of weather extreme events."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.6.6.1_p1,Brazil;Chile;Peru;Ecuador;Colombia,"Some countries have developed national plans on health including the role of climate. Chile has a Climate Change Adaptation Plan of the Health Sector that proposes several actions to enhance monitoring, institutions and citizen information and education (Ministry of Health of Chile and Ministry of Environment of Chile, 2016). Based on the identification of vulnerability to climate change, Colombia has developed 11 regional adaptation plans to strengthen institutional capacities, climate-change education for behavioural changes and cost estimation to promote health resilience (WHO and UNFCCC, 2015). In addition, El Salvador implemented actions to strengthen health infrastructure using high latrines for housing in flood communities, as well as other measures focused on water supply and quality based on an education and awareness programme (Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources of El Salvador, 2013). Only Brazil and Peru have implemented actions so far in the region derived from national health adaptation plans, and only Brazil completed a national assessment of impacts, vulnerability and adaptation for health (Watts et al., 2018). Some countries include health as a priority sector in their NAPs, as in the case of Ecuador and Costa Rica, which has a national plan addressing the prevention and care of climate-sensitive diseases coupled with a National Health Plan (2016–2020) (Ministry of Health Costa Rica, 2016; Jiménez, n. d.)."

These plans are generally promoted by governments as national instruments that guide the processes of estimating, preventing and reducing disaster risk. Updated National Risk Management Plans have been found for Guatemala (CONRED, 2014), Honduras (COPECO, 2014), El Salvador (Ministry of Health of El Salvador, 2017), Costa Rica (CNE, 2016), Ecuador (SGR, 2018), Peru (SGRD et al., 2014), Argentina (Ministerio de Seguridad de Argentina, 2018), Bolivia (VIDECI, 2017), Chile (ONEMI, 2015) and Colombia (UNGRD, 2015).

However, some people point to education, sanitation or social assistance, among other sectors (Bonatti et al., 2019). In Brazil, for example, it would be difficult to clearly separate climate-change adaptation and urban policies (high confidence) (PBMC, 2016; Barbi and da Costa Ferreira, 2017; Marques Di Giulio et al., 2017; Empresa de Pesquisa Energética, 2018; Checco and Caldas, 2019; Canil et al., 2020)."

Many case studies have been conducted on the region, but data to assess and monitor precisely the effects of climate- and weather-related disasters in migration and displacements from a broad perspective remain inaccurate (Priotto and Salvador Aruj, 2017; Abeldaño Zuñiga and Fanta Garrido, 2020). The most common climatic drivers include tropical storms and hurricanes, heavy rains, floods and droughts (Kaenzig and Piguet, 2014). Positive climatic conditions also can facilitate migration (Gray and Bilsborrow, 2013). Peru, Colombia and Guatemala are among the countries with the largest average displacements caused by hydro-meteorological causes; Brazil had 295,000 people displaced because of disasters in 2019 (Global Internal Displacement Database, https://www.internal-displacement.org/database/displacement-data)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.8.4_p5,Brazil;Peru;Guatemala,"Some areas are more likely to generate climatic migration: the Andes, the dry areas of Amazonia, northern Brazil and northern countries in CA (high confidence). Northeastern Brazil will lose population that will move to the south, deepening existing inequalities (Oliveira and Pereda, 2020). In a study of eight countries around the world, including Guatemala and Peru, a link was found between rainfall variability and food insecurity, which could lead to migration in areas of high prevalence of rainfed agriculture and low diversification (Warner and Afifi, 2014). In CA, younger individuals are more likely to migrate in response to hurricanes and especially to droughts (Baez et al., 2017)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.8.5_p2,Brazil;Mexico;Chile;Colombia;Argentina,"According to UNFCCC, Latin America and the Caribbean, for the period 2015–2016, obtained 22% of climate financing from multilateral climate funds. In this section we use data fromhttps://climatefundsupdate.org/data-dashboard, and most of the reported information for Latin American and the Caribbean includes Mexico, since the scope of this chapter does not include Mexico, so we must rely on the raw data included in the data dashboard mentioned in the link (see also Guzmán et al. [2016]). According to the data, 76% of climate-related financing went to mitigation projects, with the remaining 24% going to adaptation. Of the total financing provided by the multilateral climate funds to the region, 51% took the form of concessional loans, while 47% was provided as grants. For the region, approvals in the 2015–2016 period were concentrated in Argentina, Chile, Brazil and Colombia, where large-scale mitigation projects were launched supported by the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the Clean Technology Fund (CTF). For the period 2003–2019, the total contribution of climate financing to SA and the Caribbean is about USD 3558 million. The largest contributors to climate financing in the region come from the GCF, which approved USD 824.2 million for 23 projects. Brazil is the top recipient with USD 195 million, followed by Argentina with about USD 162 million. The second provider is the Amazon Fund with USD 717 million allocated to 102 projects in Brazil. In 2018, the CTF became the third largest source of financing, with USD 483 million dollars approved for 24 projects; the main recipient is Chile with USD 16,207 million, followed by Colombia with USD 170 million. The five largest projects approved in the region in 2018 were through the GCF. Brazil (USD 195 million) received support for reducing energy consumption across Brazilian cities, while Argentina (USD 103 million) received support to scale up investments by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in renewable energy and energy efficiency. In both cases, financing is predominantly provided as concessional loans."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.8.5_p4,Brazil,"Climate financing in the region is concentrated in Brazil, which receives a third of the region’s funding, with 41 mitigation activities receiving more than 6 times that of adaptation from multilateral climate funds. By the size of its GDP, Brazil receives the largest amount of financing; this leaves the poorest countries with little or no financing and therefore reinforces a vicious circle of poverty and vulnerability. Whether this is due to Brazil’s being more successful at presenting eligible projects, a lack of commitment from other developing countries or some other structural factors is an open question. In any case, compensation schemes for the most vulnerable countries appear as needed, given the differences in vulnerability to climate-related damage (Antimiani et al., 2017). This is aggravated by the fact that fund management is in the hands of supranational entities while inequalities remain in regions within a country, particularly in highly centralised countries, as is the case for countries in the region."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.8_p2,Brazil;Argentina,"Many extreme events are already impacting the region and are projected to intensify; such events include warming temperatures and dryness, SLR, coastal erosion and ocean and lake acidification, resulting in coral bleaching and an increasing frequency and severity of droughts in some regions, with a concomitant decrease in water supply, which impact agricultural production, traditional fishing, food security and human health (high confidence). In CA, 10.5 million people are living in the so-called Dry Corridor, a region with an extended dry season and, now, more erratic rainfall patterns. A water crisis in Brazil affected the major cities of the country between 2014 and 2016, having become more frequent since then. Severe droughts have also been reported in Paraguay and Argentina. In contrast, the urbanised areas of NSA are highly exposed to extreme floods (41% of urban population in the Amazon Delta and Estuary). Urban areas in the region are vulnerable for many reasons, notably high rates of poverty and informality, poor and unevenly distributed infrastructure, housing deficits and the recurrent occupation of risk areas (high confidence)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.8_p3,Brazil,"Socioecological systems in the region are highly vulnerable to climate change, which acts in synergy with other drivers such as land use change and deep socioeconomic inequalities. Most biodiversity hotspots in the region will be negatively impacted. The Cerrado and the Atlantic Forest (two important biodiversity hotspots where about 72% of Brazil’s threatened species can be found) are exposed to different hazards (extreme events, mean temperature increase) due to climate change. Many coastal areas and their concentrated urban populations and assets are exposed to SLR. Climate change is threatening several systems (glaciers in the Andes, coral reefs in CA, the Amazon rainforest) that are already approaching a critical state at risk of irreversible damage."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#FAQ 12.1_p5,Brazil;Peru,"Governments in the region have implemented several poverty-reduction programmes. However, policies of income redistribution and poverty alleviation do not necessarily improve climate risk management, so complementary policies integrating both social and material conditions are required. A study in northern Brazil showed that risk management strategies for droughts and food insecurity did not change poverty rates between 1997–1998 and 2011–2012. Major shocks, such as climate and extreme weather events (e.g., floods, heavy rains, droughts, frost), reduce and destroy public and private property. For instance, the ENSO event of 2017 in Peru caused losses estimated between USD 6 and 9 billion, affected more than a million inhabitants and generated 370,000 new poor. In total, losses by unemployment, deaths, destruction and damage to infrastructure and houses were around 1.3% of the GDP of Peru."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#FAQ 12.1_p6,Brazil;Mexico;Chile;Guatemala;Argentina,"Low government spending on social infrastructure (e.g., health, education), ethnic discrimination and social exclusion reduce healthcare access, leaving poor people in entire regions mostly undiagnosed or untreated. In a context of privatisation policies of healthcare systems, research shows that marginal people lack identifying documents needed to access public services in Buenos Aires (Argentina), Mexico City (Mexico) and Santiago de Chile (Chile), some of the most developed cities in the region. The consequences of this situation are underreporting, low diagnosis and low treatment of diseases such as vector-borne diseases such as dengue and risk of diarrhoeal diseases originating from frequent flooding in Amazonian riverine communities. Bias in reporting on access to healthcare and the incidence of diseases in marginal populations is usually region-dependent. For example, in Brazil’s Amazonian north in 2018, there were 2.2 medical doctors per 1000 inhabitants, while 4.95 medical doctors per 1000 inhabitants and 9.52 doctors in São Paulo and Santa Catarina respectively. Another example is pregnant women in remote Amazonian municipalities, who receive less prenatal care than women in urban areas. These social inequities underlie systemic biases in health data quality, hindering reliable estimation of disease burdens such as the distribution of disease or birth and death registrations. For example, in Guatemala, alternative Indigenous healthcare systems are responding to local needs in Mayan communities. However, this remains unrecognised. The existence of health institutions based on IK can reinforce the lack of universal coverage by central government healthcare, addressing the miscalculation of morbidity, mortality and cause of death among disadvantaged groups."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#FAQ 12.2_p10,Brazil;Chile;Peru;Argentina,"Cities struggle to address the immediate needs of their population while addressing longer-term needs associated with climate adaptation, emissions reduction and sustainable development. Some cities are moving forward to transformative adaptation, addressing drivers of vulnerability, building robust systems and anticipating impacts. Besides government-led adaptation planning and action, individuals, communities and enterprises have been incrementally adapting to climate change autonomously over time. Municipalities from Argentina, Peru, Chile, Equator, Brazil and Costa Rica are developing and implementing their Local Climate Action Plans, experimenting with and revealing best practices in adaptation. Both anticipatory adaptation measures—choosing safe locations, building structurally safe houses, choosing elevated places to store valuables, building on stilts—and reactive adaptation measures are used, the latter incorporating measures such as relocation, slope stabilisation, afforestation and greening of riverbanks. With variations, these cities have included mechanisms to work across sectors and actors on the understanding that it is collective planning and actions that will ensure that long-term programmes continue independently of particular city administrations."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#FAQ 12.3_p3,Brazil;Guatemala;Honduras,"The increasing frequency and magnitude of droughts, tropical storms, hurricanes and heavy rains producing landslides and floods have amplified internal movements, overall rural to urban. For instance, rural-to-urban migration in northern Brazil and international migration from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to North America are partly a consequence of prolonged droughts, which have increased the stress of food availability in these highly impoverished regions. Diminished access to water is also a result of privatisation of that resource. In CA, the majority of migrants are young men, reducing the labour force in their places of origin. However, the migrants send back substantial amounts of money, which have become the main source of foreign exchange for their countries and the main source of income for their families."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#FAQ 12.3_p5,Brazil,"The magnitude and frequency of droughts and hurricanes are projected to keep increasing by 2050, which may force millions of people to leave their homes. Climate models show some dry regions becoming even dryer in the coming decades, increasing the stress on small farmers who rely on rainfall to water their fields. Glacier retreat and water scarcity are becoming strong drivers of migration in the Andes. SLR affects activities such as fishing and tourism, which will foster further migration. In Brazil, at least 0.9 million more people will migrate interregionally under future climate conditions."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#FAQ 12.4_p7,Brazil;Colombia,"Agroforestry systems are present in the tropical region of CSA. Trees are present in a large part of the agricultural landscape of this region, either dispersed or in lines, supporting the production of coffee, cocoa, fruits, pastures and livestock in various agroforestry configurations. In CA, shade-grown coffee reduces weed control and improves the quality and taste of the product. Agroforestry uses nitrogen-fixing trees (Leguminosae), such as Leucaena in Colombia and Inga in Brazil, to restore soil nitrogen fertility. Tropical forest soils are generally nutrient-poor and unsuited to long-term agricultural use. Land converted to agriculture by cutting and burning natural vegetation tends to remain productive for only a few years. Agroforestry and so-called silvopastoral systems, which incorporate trees into crop and livestock systems, have been shown to have a dramatic impact on the maintenance and restoration of long-term productivity in agricultural landscapes, including degraded and abandoned land. Agroforestry systems can provide major benefits through enhanced food security, stronger local economies and increased ecosystem services such as carbon storage, regulation of climate and water cycles, control of pests and diseases and maintenance of soil fertility. Because of these multiple goods and services, agroforestry practices are considered one of the key strategies for the development of climate-smart agriculture."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#FAQ 12.5_p5,Brazil;Venezuela,"Traditional fire management among Indigenous Peoples of Venezuela, Brazil and Guyana is another adaptation strategy based on a fine-tuned understanding of environmental indicators associated with their culture and worldviews. In these countries, Indigenous lands have the lowest incidence of wildfires, significantly contributing to maintaining and enhancing biodiversity.

Urban population densities have consistently declined in Australia, Japan and New Zealand, and Europe, North America, and Southern Asia regions, across all city sizes. North America consistently had the lowest urban population densities. Notably, the Middle East region appears to be the only region exhibiting an overall increasing trend across all city-size groups, while Latin America and Caribbean appears to be relatively stable for all city sizes. While the larger cities in Africa and South-East Asia and Pacific exhibit slightly stable urban population densities, the small and medium-sized cities in those regions trend toward lower urban population densities. In large urban centres of Eastern Asia and North America, rapid decreases in earlier decades seem to have tapered. Compared to larger cities, small-medium urban areas with populations of less than 2 million have more declines in urban population densities and higher rates of urban land expansion (Güneralp et al. 2020)."

Drought-related tree mortality rates from 1987 to 2016 were highest in the Ukraine, Moldova, southern France and Spain (Senf et al., 2020). Climate contributed to tree mortality across Europe from 1958 to 2001 (Seidl et al., 2011). In addition, insect infestations related to higher temperatures (Okland et al., 2019) have caused the extensive mortality of Norway spruce (Picea abies) across nine European countries (Marini et al., 2017; Mezei et al., 2017). Across the Mediterranean Basin, a combination of drought, wildfire, pest infestations and livestock grazing (Peñuelas and Sardans, 2021) has driven tree mortality.

Cold-water fish, such as coregonids and smelt have been negatively affected at the equatorial borders of their distributions (Jeppesen et al., 2012). Upward elevational range shifts in rivers and streams have been observed. Systematic shifts towards higher elevation and upstream were found for 32 stream-fish species in France following regional variation in climate change (Comte and Grenouillet, 2013). Bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) in Idaho (USA), were estimated to have lost 11–20% (8–16% per decade) of the headwater stream lengths necessary for cold-water spawning and early juvenile rearing, with the largest losses occurring in the coldest habitats (Isaak et al., 2010). Range contractions of the same species have been found in the Rocky Mountains watershed (Eby et al., 2014). Likewise, the distribution of the stonefly Zapada glacier, endemic to the alpine streams of the Glacier National Park in Montana (USA), has been reduced over several decades by an upstream retreat to higher, cooler sites as water temperatures have increased and glacial masses have decreased (Giersch et al., 2015)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.2.3.1_p2,France,"Analyses indicated that responses in range shifts and timing were lagging behind the changes expected from regional warming. This type of lag, where biological response is less than expected from known underlying physiology or general climatic limits, is called ‘climate debt’. Examples of climate debt, measured from community composition changes, come from birds and butterflies in Europe (Devictor et al., 2012) and lowland forest herbaceous plants in France (Bertrand et al., 2011). The French study found that larger debts occurred in communities with warmer baseline conditions and that some of the apparent debt stemmed from the ability of species to tolerate warming in situ, so no range shift was observed."

Climate change is causing these droughts to become more frequent and severe (medium evidence, medium agreement ) (AghaKouchak et al., 2014; Garreaud et al., 2017; Otto et al., 2018; Seneviratne et al., 2021)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.3.4_p3,South Africa;Spain,"Declines in plant health and increased mortality in MTEs associated with drought have been widely documented (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Section 2.4.4.3). Remote-sensing studies show drought-associated mortality in post-fire vegetation regrowth in the Fynbos of South Africa (Slingsby et al., 2020b), reduced canopy health in forests within MTE zones of South Africa (Hope et al., 2014) and declines in canopy water content in the forests of California (Asner et al., 2016a). Several studies reported climate-associated responses of dominant or charismatic species. High mortality in the Clanwilliam cedar tree between 1931 and 2013 occurred at lower, hotter elevations in the Fynbos of South Africa (White et al., 2016). Drought reduced growth and increased mortality of the holm oak, Quercus ilex, on the Iberian Peninsula of Spain (Natalini et al. (2016). Portuguese shrublands experienced losses of many deciduous and evergreen oak species, and an increasing dominance of pyrophytic xeric trees (Acácio et al., 2017). The 2012–2015 drought in California caused high-canopy foliage dieback of the giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) (Stephenson et al., 2019), increased the dominance of oaks relative to pines as a result of the increased water deficit, and led to large-scale tree mortality due to interactions of drought and insect pest outbreaks (McIntyre et al., 2015; Fettig et al., 2019)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.3.4_p4,South Africa;Italy,"Species distribution or community composition changes have contributed to declines in diversity and/or shifts towards more drought- or heat-adapted species (medium evidence, high agreement ). Two conifer species (Pinus longaeva and P. flexilis) shifted upslope 19 m from 1950 to 2016 in the Great Basin, USA, (Smithers et al., 2018). Reduced winter precipitation caused native annual forbs to recede, resulting in long-lasting and potentially unidirectional reductions in diversity in a Californian grassland (Harrison et al., 2018). More frequent extreme hot and dry weather between 1966 and 2010 caused a decline in diversity during the post-fire regeneration phase in the Fynbos of South Africa (Slingsby et al., 2017), resulting in shifts towards species with higher temperature preferences (Slingsby et al., 2017). In Italy, Del Vecchio et al. (2015) observed increases in plant cover and thermophilic species in coastal foredune habitats between 1989 and 2012."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.3.4_p6,South Africa;Chile,"The effects of climate change on heat, fuel and wildfire ignition limits show spatial and temporal variation globally (see Section 2.3.6.1), but there have been a number of observed impacts on MTEs (medium evidence, high agreement ). Climate change caused increases in fuel aridity and the area of land burned by wildfires across the western USA from 1985 to 2015 (Abatzoglou and Williams, 2016). Local and global climatic variability led to a 4-year decrease in the average fire return time in the Fynbos, South Africa, when comparing fires recorded in 1951–1975 and 1976–2000 (Wilson et al., 2010). In Chile, González et al. (2018) reported a significant increase in the number, size, duration and simultaneity of large fires during the 2010–2015 ‘megadrought’ when compared to the 1990–2009 baseline."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.4.2.5_p1,South Africa,"Globally, fire has contributed to biome shifts (Section 2.4.3.2) and tree mortality (Sections 2.4.4.2, 2.4.4.3) attributed to anthropogenic climate change. Research since the AR5 has also found vegetation changes from wildfire due to climate change. Through increased temperature and aridity, anthropogenic climate change has driven post-fire changes in plant regeneration and species composition in South Africa (Slingsby et al., 2017), and tree regeneration in the western USA (Davis et al., 2019b). In the fynbos vegetation of the Cape Floristic Region, South Africa, post-fire heat and drought and the legacy effects of exotic plant species reduced the regeneration of native plant species, decreasing species richness by 12% from 1966 to 2010 and shifting the average temperature tolerance of species communities upward by 0.5°C (Slingsby et al., 2017). In burned areas across the western USA, the increasing heat and aridity of anthropogenic climate change from 1979 to 2015 pushed low-elevation ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests across critical thresholds of heat and aridity that reduced the post-fire tree regeneration by half (Davis et al., 2019b). In the southwestern USA, where anthropogenic climate change has caused drought (Williams et al., 2019) and increased wildfire (Abatzoglou and Williams, 2016), high-severity fires have converted some forest patches to shrublands (Barton and Poulos, 2018). Field evidence shows that anthropogenic climate change and wildfire, together, altered vegetation species composition in the southwestern USA and Cape floristic region, South Africa, reducing post-fire natural regeneration and species richness of tree and other plant species, between 1966 and 2015, at GMST increases of 0.3°C–0.9°C (medium evidence, high agreement )."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.4.3.2_p2,South Africa;Algeria;Tunisia,"In the African Sahel, field research has continued to detect tree mortality, ranging from 20 to 90% in the period 1965–2018 (Kusserow, 2017; Trichon et al., 2018; Dendoncker et al., 2020), and declines in tree biodiversity, with up to 80% local losses of tree species in the period 1970–2014 (Hanke et al., 2016; Kusserow, 2017; Ibrahim et al., 2018; Dendoncker et al., 2020), consistent with, but not formally attributed to, climate change. In Algeria, mortality of the Atlas cedar (Cedrus atlantica) increased from 1980 to 2006, coinciding with a ~1°C spring temperature increase, but non-climate factors were not examined (Navarro-Cerrillo et al., 2019). Across southern Africa, nine of the 13 oldest known (1100–2500 years old) baobab trees (Adansonia digitata) have died since 2005, although the causes are unknown (Patrut et al., 2018). In South Africa, savanna trees experienced an order of magnitude increase in mortality, related, but not formally attributed to, decreased rainfall (Case et al., 2019). In Tunisia, insect infestations related, but not formally attributed to, hotter temperatures led to mortality of cork oaks (Quercus suber) (Bellahirech et al., 2019)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.2.4 _p1,South Africa;Australia;Chile,"The regions containing MTEs all show high confidence in projected increases in the intensity and frequency of hot extremes and decreases in the intensity and frequency of cold extremes, and medium confidence in increasing ecological drought due to increased evapotranspiration (in all regions) and reduced rainfall (excluding California, USA, where model agreement is low) (see WGI Chapter 11). Projections also show a robust  increase in the intensity and frequency of heavy precipitation in the event of ≥2°C warming for MTEs in South Africa, the Mediterranean Basin and California, USA, but are less clear for Australia and Chile (Seneviratne et al., 2021)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.3_p6,South Africa,"In river systems (Iacob et al., 2014), management of both the catchments and the channel itself is important: restoring natural meanders in canalised watercourses and allowing the build-up of woody debris can slow flows rates; restoring upstream wetlands or creating them in urban and peri-urban situations can store water during flood events if they are in the right place in a catchment (Acreman and Holden, 2013; Ameli and Creed, 2019; Wu et al., 2020). There is less data on the potential for NFM in tropical compared to temperate catchments. However, (Ogden et al., 2013) showed that flooding was reduced from a secondary forested catchment area compared to those which were pasture or a mosaic of forest, pasture and subsistence agriculture. EbA approaches to reduce flooding can be applied within urban areas as well as in rural catchments, as in Durban, South Africa (Section 2.6.5.7), but effectiveness will depend on EbA being implemented at a sufficient scale and in the right locations (Hobbie and Grimm, 2020; Costa et al., 2021). This may, in turn, provide protection to downstream urban communities."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.5_p2,South Africa,"Adaptation can take place on a range of scales, with specific projects nested within overarching national strategies. Small-scale projects can be adaptation-focused, but on the larger scale, adaptation is often integrated with wider objectives. Within an urban or peri-urban context, the benefits of natural and semi-natural areas for health and well-being help to justify support for EbA. Economic well-being is also an important factor in many cases whether, as in Durban, South Africa (Section 2.6.5.7), it provides new job opportunities or, as in the Andes (Section 2.6.5.4), it supports long-established agricultural practices. Action on the ground often depends on factors on a range of scales, for example, a local plan, a national strategy and international funding. In Durban, partnerships between local communities, local authorities and the academic community were essential, together with an international context. Nevertheless, there are examples of communities using traditional or local knowledge (LK) to adapt to changing circumstances, with little or no external input, (Section 2.6.5.4); Their scope for adaptation is, however, often limited by factors beyond their direct control."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.5_p3,South Africa,"Specific interventions to protect species from climate change, such as the case of African penguins in South Africa (Section 2.6.5.5) and threatened plant species in the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area (Section 2.6.5.8), are rare. However, in countries where nature reserves are actively managed or where ecosystem restoration projects are progressing, local practitioners may use their knowledge to adapt to weather conditions and their associated effects (e.g., fire and water shortages). This is good practice, but it may not be sufficient to address the likely future changes in climate (Duffield et al., 2021). Training and resources to support conservation practitioners are becoming available. Examples include the Climate Change Adaptation Manual in England, UK (Section 2.6.5.2), and The Alliance for Freshwater Life (https://allianceforfreshwaterlife.org) which provides expertise for the sustainable management of freshwater biodiversity (Darwall et al., 2018)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.5.5 _p3,South Africa,"The African penguin, Spheniscus demersus, is the only resident penguin species on mainland Africa. It breeds in a handful of colonies in South Africa and Namibia. In 2017, the penguins of Cape Town’s Boulders Beach colony attracted almost one million visitors, providing 885 jobs and USD 18.9 M in revenue (Van Zyl and Kinghorn, 2018). Ninety-six percent of the population of this species has been lost since 1900, with a 77% decline in the last two decades (Sherley et al., 2018). By 2019, only 17,700 pairs remained (Sherley et al., 2020). The species is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List (Birdlife International, 2018) and if this trajectory persists, the African penguin will become functionally extinct in the near future (Sherley et al., 2018)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.7_p7,South Africa;Cambodia,"In some cases, actions supported by international donors and presented as addressing climate change adaptation and mitigation in the natural environment can have damaging consequences for people and nature as well as failing to deliver adaptation and mitigation. One example of this was presented by Work et al. (2019), who reviewed three climate change mitigation and adaptation projects in Cambodia: an irrigation project, a protected-area forest management project and a reforestation project. In each case, they found evidence of the rights of local communities being violated, maladaptation and the destruction of biodiverse habitats. They concluded that the potential for maladaptation and adverse social and environmental impacts had been ignored by international donors and the national authorities, and that there was a need for much stricter accountability mechanisms. Moyo et al. (2021), using case studies from South Africa, documented greater success of ecosystem restoration projects when they embraced broader SDGs, particularly enhancement of people’s livelihoods. Better assessment of the impacts of adaptation and mitigation measures on people and ecosystems, before they are implemented, will be increasingly necessary to avoid unintended and damaging consequences as their deployment is scaled up (Larsen, 2014; Enríquez-de-Salamanca et al., 2017; Pour et al., 2017). This applies to ostensibly nature-based approaches as well as more engineering-based ones."

Deforestation of mangrove forests caused 10–30% of deforestation emissions in Indonesia from 1980 to 2005 (Donato et al., 2011; Murdiyarso et al., 2015), even though mangroves comprised only 3% of Indonesia primary forest area in 2000 (Margono et al., 2014; Murdiyarso et al., 2015)."

Prolonged droughts associated with El Niño (Section 4.4.3.2) compound the effects of drainage, leading to large recurrent fires (Langner and Siegert, 2009; Gaveau et al., 2014; Putra et al., 2019). Under RCP8.5, it is projected that by the end of this century, the annual rainfall over SEA will decrease significantly (by 30%), and the number of consecutive dry days will increase significantly (by 60%) over Indonesia and Malaysia (Supari et al., 2020). Peat degradation and losses to fire result in high GHG emissions (Miettinen et al., 2016) as well as haze pollution which is a trans-boundary problem in the region (Heil et al., 2007)."

Since then, thousands of new studies and additional species have been added, leading to higher confidence in climate change attribution (Table 2.2) (Scheffers et al., 2016; Wiens, 2016; Cohen et al., 2018; Feeley et al., 2020). Freshwater habitats have been under-represented in prior reports, but new long-term datasets, coupled with laboratory and field experiments, are improving our understanding. This assessment stresses observations from lakes and streams. As numbers of studies increase and data is increasingly extracted from areas with high LULCC, attribution is more difficult as habitat loss and fragmentation are known major drivers of changes in terrestrial and freshwater species (Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, 2018; IPBES, 2019; Tickner et al., 2020). Due to the overwhelming volume of literature, the assessments for chapter 2 concentrates on results from large continental or global-scale reviews and meta-analyses. Most of the assessment of studies conducted in individual countries can be found in Regional chapters, but this chapter does include studies across very large countries or political entities that occupy much of a continent (e.g., Canada, the USA, Australia or Europe), or studies that provide rare or uniquely-relevant information."

Major declines have been recorded for several species, population extinctions have occured at lower elevations since the early 2000s, and the white sub-species of the lemuroid ringtail possum (Hemibelideus lemuroides) in Queensland, Australia, disappeared after heat waves in 2005 (high confidence): intensive censuses found only 2 individuals in 2009 (Chandler, 2014; Weber et al., 2021)."

SLR and documented increases in storm surge and in tropical cyclones, driven by climate change, led to multiple inundations of the island in the 2000s. Between 1998 and 2014, herbacious vegetation, the food resource for the BC melomys, declined by 97% in area (from 2.2 down to 0.065 hectares), and from 11 plant species down to two (Gynther et al., 2016; Watson, 2016; Woinarski, 2016; Woinarski et al., 2017). The island was unihabited with few non-climatic threats, providing high confidence in the attribution of extinction of the BC melomys to climate change-driven increases in the frequency and duration of island inundation (Turner and Batianoff, 2007; Woinarski et al., 2014; Gynther et al., 2016; Watson, 2016; Woinarski et al., 2017)."

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.4.2.1_p1,Australia,"Wildfire is a natural and essential component of many forest and other terrestrial ecosystems. Excessive wildfire, however, can kill people, cause respiratory disease, destroy houses, emit carbon dioxide and damage ecosystem integrity (see Sections 2.4.4.2 and 2.4.4.4). Anthropogenic climate change increases wildfire by exacerbating its three principal driving factors: heat, fuel and ignition (Moritz et al., 2012; Jolly et al., 2015). Non-climatic factors also contribute to wildfires—in tropical areas, fires are set intentionally to clear forest for agricultural fields and livestock pastures (Bowman et al., 2020). Urban areas and roads create ignition hazards. Governments in many temperate-zone countries implement policies to suppress fires, even natural ones, producing unnatural accumulations of fuel in the form of coarse woody debris and high densities of small trees (Ruffault and Mouillot, 2015; Hessburg et al., 2016; Andela et al., 2017; Balch et al., 2017; Lasslop and Kloster, 2017; Aragao et al., 2018; Kelley et al., 2019). Globally, 4.2 million km 2 of land per year burned on average from 2002 to 2016 (Giglio et al., 2018), with the highest fire frequencies in the Amazon rainforest, deciduous forests and savannas in Africa and deciduous forests in northern Australia (Earl and Simmonds, 2018; Andela et al., 2019)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.4.2.2_p1,Australia;Russia,"Regarding global terrestrial area as a whole, wildfire trends vary depending on the time period of analysis. From 1900 to 2000, global average fire frequency, based on field data, increased 0.4% but the change was not statistically significant (Gonzalez et al., 2010). Fire frequency increased on one-third of global land, mainly from burning for agricultural clearing in Africa, Asia and South America, slightly less than the area of fire frequency decrease, mainly from fire suppression across Australia, North America and Russia (Gonzalez et al., 2010). Analyses of the Global Fire Emissions Database document shows that, from 1996 to 2015, global burned area decreased at a rate of −0.7% yr -1 (Forkel et al., 2019) but the change was not statistically significant (Giglio et al., 2013). From 1998 to 2015, global burned area decreased at a rate of −1.4 ± 0.5% yr -1 (Andela et al., 2017). The area of fire increases was one-third of the area of decreases, due to reduced vegetation cover from agricultural expansion and intensification (Andela et al., 2017) and from increased precipitation (Forkel et al., 2019). Furthermore, much of the decreasing trend derives from two years: 1998 with a high burned area and 2013 with low burned area (Forkel et al., 2019). Wildfire does not show a clear long-term trend for the world as a whole because of increases and decreases in different regions (medium evidence, medium agreement )."

In addition to the deaths of dozens of people and the destruction of thousands of houses, the 2019–2020 bushfires burned almost half of the area protected for conservation in Victoria, two-thirds of the forests allocated for timber harvesting (Lindenmayer and Taylor, 2020), wildlife and extensive areas of habitat for threatened plant and animal species (Geary et al., 2021). Generally, past timber harvesting did not lead to more severe fire canopy damage (Bowman et al., 2021b). Across southeastern Australia, the fraction of vegetated area that burned increased significantly in eight of the 32 bioregions from 1975 to 2009, but decreased significantly in three bioregions (Bradstock et al., 2014). Increases in four bioregions were correlated to increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation. Decreases in burned area occurred despite increased temperature and decreased precipitation. Analyses of climate across Australia from 1950 to 2017 (Dowdy, 2018; Harris and Lucas, 2019) and during periods with extensive fires in 2017 in eastern Australia (Hope et al., 2019), in 2018 in northeastern Australia (Lewis et al., 2020), and in period 2019–2020 in southeastern Australia (Abram et al., 2021; van Oldenborgh et al., 2021) indicate that temperature and drought extremes due to the ENSO, Southern Annular Mode and other natural inter-decadal cycles drive inter-annual variability of fire weather. While the effects of inter-decadal climate cycles on fire are superimposed on long-term climate change, the relative importance of anthropogenic climate change in explaining changes in burned area in Australia remains unquantified (medium evidence, high agreement )."

The global increases in temperature from anthropogenic climate change have increased aridity and drought, lengthening the fire weather season (the annual period with a heat and aridity index greater than half of its annual range) on one-quarter of global vegetated area and increasing the average fire season length by one-fifth from 1979 to 2013 (Jolly et al., 2015). Climate change has contributed to increases in the fire weather season or the probability of fire weather conditions in the Amazon (Jolly et al., 2015), Australia (Dowdy, 2018; Abram et al., 2021; van Oldenborgh et al., 2021), Canada (Hanes et al., 2019), central Asia (Jolly et al., 2015), East Africa (Jolly et al., 2015) and North America (Jain et al., 2017; Williams et al., 2019; Goss et al., 2020). In forest areas, the burned area correlates with fuel aridity, a function of temperature; in non-forest areas, the burned area correlates with high precipitation in the previous year, which can produce high grass fuel loads (Abatzoglou et al., 2018). Fire use in agriculture and raising livestock or other factors have generated a second fire season on approximately one-quarter of global land where fire is present, despite sub-optimal fire weather in the second fire season (Benali et al., 2017). In summary, anthropogenic climate change, through a 0.9°C surface temperature increase since the pre-industrial period, has lengthened or increased the frequency of periods with heat and aridity that favour wildfire on up to one-quarter of vegetated area since 1979 (robust evidence, high agreement )."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.4.3.1_p4,Australia,"In summary, anthropogenic climate change caused drought-induced tree mortality of up to 20% in the period 1945–2007 in western North America, the African Sahel and North Africa, via global temperature increases of 0.3°C–0.9°C above the pre-industrial period and increases in aridity, and it contributed to over 100 other cases of drought-induced tree mortality in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe and North and South America (high confidence). Field observations document accelerating mortality rates, rising background mortality and post-mortality vegetation shifts (high confidence). Water stress, leading to plant hydraulic failure, is the principal mechanism of drought-induced tree mortality. Timber cutting, agricultural expansion, air pollution and other non-climate factors also contribute to tree death."

Overall, in areas with documented high tree mortality, bird abundances increased (n=186 bird species), there was no significant trend for mammals (n=33 species), a slight trend towards declines in invertebrates (n=28 species), and insufficient information to categorize the responses of reptiles (n=20 species). However, within groups, significant differences appeared. Mammals that use trees as refugia showed declines with tree mortality  (high confidence)  , but flying mammals (e.g. bats) increased  (medium confidence). Ground-nesting, ground-foraging, tree-hole nesting and bark-foraging birds increased most, but nectar-feeding and foliage-gleaning birds declined  (high confidence).

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.4.4.4_p1,Australia,"Most global deforestation is occurring in tropical forests (Pan et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2015; Houghton and Nassikas, 2017; Erb et al., 2018a; Li et al., 2018; Harris et al., 2021), primarily as a result of clearing for agricultural land (Hong et al., 2021), causing primary tropical forest to comprise a net source of carbon from 2001 to 2019: emissions to the atmosphere 0.6 GtC yr -1, removals from the atmosphere -0.5 GtC yr -1 and net 0.1 GtC yr -1 (Harris et al., 2021). While wildfires emitted an average of 0.4 ± 0.2 GtC yr -1 from 1997 to 2016 (van der Werf et al., 2017), individual fire seasons can emit the same magnitude, such as the 0.4 GtC from the Amazon fires of 2007 (Aragao et al., 2018), the 0.5 GtC from the Amazon fires of 2015–2016 (Berenguer et al., 2021) and the 0.2 Gt from the Australia fires of 2019–2020 (Shiraishi and Hirata, 2021). Wildfires thus account for up to one-third of annual average ecosystem carbon emissions, while major fire seasons can emit up to two-thirds of global ecosystem carbon (medium evidence, medium agreement )."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#FAQ 2.3_p6,Australia;Canada;Indonesia,"In other regions, wildfires are also burning wider areas and occurring more often. This is consistent with climate change, but analyses have not yet shown if climate change is more important than other factors. In the Amazon, deforestation by companies, farmers and herders who cut down and intentionally burn rainforests to expand agricultural fields and pastures causes wildfires even in relatively moister years. Drought exacerbates these fires. In Australia, much of the southeastern part of the continent has experienced extreme wildfire years, but analyses suggest that El Niño, a heat phenomenon that cycles up and down periodically, is more important than long-term climate change. In Indonesia, intentional burning of rainforests for oil palm plantations and El Niño seem to be more important than long-term climate change. In Mediterranean Europe, fire suppression seems to have prevented any increasing trend in burned area but the suppression and abandonment of agricultural lands have allowed fuel to build up in some areas and contribute to major fires in years of extreme heat. In Canada and Siberia, wildfires are now burning more often in permafrost areas where fire was rare, but analyses are lacking regarding the relative influence of climate change. For the world as a whole, satellite data indicate that the vast amount of land converted from forest to farmland in the period 1998–2015 actually decreased the total burned area. Nevertheless, the evidence from the forests of western North America shows that human-caused climate change has, at least on one continent, clearly driven increases in wildfire."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.5_p8,Australia,"Globally, increases in temperature, aridity and drought have increased the length of fire seasons and doubled the potentially burnable land area (medium confidence). Increases in the area burned have been attributed to anthropogenic climate change in North America (high confidence). In parts of Africa, Asia, Australia and South America, the area burned has also increased, consistent with anthropogenic climate change. Deforestation, peat-burning, agricultural expansion or abandonment, fire suppression and inter-decadal cycles strongly influence fire occurrence. The areas with the greatest increases in the length of the fire season include the Amazon, western North America, western Asia and East Africa (Section 2.4.4.2)."

About one-third of land area risks more than 50% of species becoming “endangered” by 4.0° GSAT warming (Figure 2.6). That is, the deep orange and red areas in Figure 2.6 are those areas for which >50% of species currently inhabiting those ecosystems are projected to lose >50% of their climatically suitable habitat.

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.2.3_p1,Australia,"Shifts in arid system structure and functioning that have been observed to date (Section 2.4.3.3) are projected to continue  (medium confidence). These include widespread woody plant encroachment, notably in savanna systems in Africa, Australia and South America, and are attributed to interactions of LULCC, climate change and CO2 fertilisation effects (Fensholt et al., 2012; Fang et al., 2017; Stevens et al., 2017). Arid Mongolian steppe grassland did not respond to experimentally elevated CO2 (Song et al., 2019). Woody encroachment is projected to continue or not reverse in North American drylands (Caracciolo et al., 2016) and southern African arid ecosystems (Moncrieff et al., 2014b). Dryland woody encroachment may increase carbon stocks, depending on emissions scenario (Martens et al., 2021), but reduce soil water and biodiversity of grassland-dependent species diversity (Archer et al., 2017). Warm season (C4) grass expansion into arid shrublands risks sudden ecosystem transformation due to introduced wildfire (Bradley et al., 2016), a risk anticipated for grass-invaded desert ecosystems of Australia and the southwestern USA (Horn and St. Clair, 2017). Novel fire regimes in grassy shrublands have enhanced grass cover locally in the southern African Nama-Karoo (du Toit et al., 2015)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.2.5_p2,Australia,"The relative importance of climate, disturbance (e.g., fire/herbivory) and plant feedbacks in shaping present and future savanna distribution varies between continents (Lehmann et al., 2014), which makes projections of changing the biome extent challenging (Moncrieff et al., 2016). It has been shown that simulation studies that do not account for CO2 interactions but only consider climate change impacts do not realistically capture the future distribution of savannas (high confidence) (Higgins and Scheiter, 2012; Moncrieff et al., 2016; Scheiter et al., 2020). Due to the continued strong effect of CO2 on tree and shrub-to-grass ratios in future, models suggest a loss of savanna extent and conversion into closed canopy forest/thicket and an expansion of savanna-type vegetation into arid grasslands (Wårlind et al., 2014; Moncrieff et al., 2016). In arid savannas and their interface to grasslands, survival of woody vegetation (which may be stimulated to grow by increasing CO2) will depend on their capacity to survive potentially more severe and frequent droughts (Sankaran and Staver, 2019). Across a range of models, for RCP4.5 future climate change and CO2 concentrations, savanna expanse declines by around 50% (converting to closed canopy systems) by 2070 in Africa and South America, 25% in Asia and with small changes in Australia (Moncrieff et al., 2016; Kumar et al., 2021). Future fire-spread is expected to be reduced with increased woody dominance (Scheiter et al., 2015; Knorr et al., 2016b; Scheiter et al., 2020), feeding back to further increase tree-to-grass ratios (high confidence)."

cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.3.3_p1,Australia,"At the moment, climate change impact on mitigation potential is hardly considered in model-based scenarios. While a detailed overview of climate impacts is provided in IPCC AR6 WGII and Section 3.6 discusses the economic consequences, here we concentrate on the implications for mitigation potential. Climate change directly impacts the carbon budget via all kinds of feedbacks – which is included in the ranges provided for the carbon budget (e.g., 300–900 GtCO2 for 17th–83rd percentile for not exceeding 1.5°C; see AR6 WGI Chapter 5, 2021). Climate change, however, alters the production and consumption of energy (Section 6.5). An overview of the literature is provided by Yalew et al. (2020). In terms of supply, impacts could influence the cooling capacity of thermal plants, the potential and predictability of renewable energy, and energy infrastructure (van Vliet et al. 2016; Turner et al. 2017; Cronin et al. 2018a; Lucena et al. 2018; Yalew et al. 2020; Gernaat et al. 2021). Although the outcomes of these studies differ, they seem to suggest that although impacts might be relatively small at the global scale, they could be substantial at the regional scale (increasing or decreasing potential). Climate change can also impact energy demand, with rising temperatures resulting in decreases in heating demand and increases in cooling demand (Isaac and van Vuuren 2009; Zhou et al. 2014; Labriet et al. 2015; McFarland et al. 2015; Auffhammer et al. 2017; Clarke et al. 2018; van Ruijven et al. 2019; Yalew et al. 2020). As expected, the increase in cooling demand dominates the impact in warm regions and decreases in heating demand in cold regions (Isaac and van Vuuren 2009; Zhou et al. 2014; Clarke et al. 2018). Globally, most studies show a net increase in energy demand at the end of the century due to climate impacts (Isaac and van Vuuren 2009; Clarke et al. 2018; van Ruijven et al. 2019); however, one study shows a net decrease (Labriet et al. 2015). Only a few studies quantify the combined impacts of climate change on energy supply and energy demand (McFarland et al. 2015; Mima and Criqui 2015; Emodi et al. 2019; Steinberg et al. 2020). These studies show increases in electricity generation in the USA (McFarland et al. 2015; Steinberg et al. 2020) and increases in CO2 emissions in Australia (Emodi et al. 2019) or the USA (McFarland et al. 2015)."

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#FAQ 2.3_p5,Switzerland;Canada,"Evidence shows that human-caused climate change has driven increases in the area burned by wildfire in the forests of western North America. Across this region, the higher temperatures of human-caused climate change doubled burned area from 1984 to 2015, compared with what would have burned without climate change (Figure FAQ2.3.1b). The additional area burned, 4.9 million hectares, is greater than the land area of Switzerland. Human-caused climate change drove a drought from 2000 to 2020 that has been the most severe since the 1500s, severely increasing the aridity of vegetation. In British Columbia, Canada, the higher maximum temperatures of human-caused climate change increased burned area in 2017 to its widest extent in the 1950–2017 record, seven to eleven times the area that would have burned without climate change. Moreover, in national parks and other protected areas of Canada and the USA, most of the area burned from 1984 to 2014 can be attributed to climate factors (temperature, rainfall and aridity) and these outweigh local human factors (population density, roads and urban area)."

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.2.3.1_p1,Canada,"The most common type of community change takes the form of in situ decreases in cold-adapted species and increases in warm-adapted species (Bowler et al., 2017; Hughes et al., 2018; Kuhn and Gégout, 2019; Feeley et al., 2020). This process has lead to increases of species richness on mountaintops and decreased richness at adjacent lower elevations (medium evidence, high agreement ) (Forister et al., 2010; Steinbauer et al., 2018). While it is also expected from observed range shifts of individual species that species richness should increase along tropical/temperate ecotones and along temperate/boreal ecotones, to date this has not been well documented. Lewthwaite et al (Lewthwaite and Mooers, 2022) documented a small increase in local richness across Canada for 265 species of butterflies, but the stronger effect was an homogenization across the region, with generalist species generally expanding into new sites and leading to lower Beta-diversity (lower diversity among sites). In a study of 66 bumble bee species across North America and Europe, Soroye et al (Soroye et al., 2020) did not find the expected pattern, with most sites, regardless of latitude, declining in species richness, even when individual species benefited from warming or increased precipitation at some sites. Observed shifts in community composition have consequences for species’ interactions. Such indirect effects of climate change have been shown to often have greater impacts on species than the direct effects of climate itself, particularly for higher-level consumers (Cahill et al., 2013; Ockendon et al., 2014)."

Remote sensing suggests that the area of temperate and boreal forests increased in Asia and Europe between 1982 and 2016 (Song et al., 2018) and in Canada between 1984 and 2015 (Guindon et al., 2018), but forest plantations and regrowth are probable drivers (Song et al., 2018)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.4.2.1_p2,Canada,"Since the AR5 and the IPCC Special Report on Land, published research has detected increases in the area burned by wildfire, analysed relative contributions of climate and non-climate factors and attributed burned area increases above natural (recent historical) levels to anthropogenic climate change in one part of the world, western North America (robust evidence, high agreement)  (Abatzoglou and Williams, 2016; Partain et al., 2016; Kirchmeier-Young et al., 2019; Mansuy et al., 2019; Bowman et al., 2020). Across the western USA, increases in vegetation aridity due to higher temperatures from anthropogenic climate change doubled burned area from 1984 to 2015 over what would have burned due to non-climate factors including unnatural fuel accumulation from fire suppression, with the burned area attributed to climate change accounting for 49% (32–76%, 95% confidence interval) of cumulative burned area (Abatzoglou and Williams, 2016). Anthropogenic climate change doubled the severity of a southwest North American drought from 2000 to 2020 that has reduced soil moisture to its lowest levels since the 1500s (Williams et al., 2020), driving half of the increase in burned area (Abatzoglou and Williams, 2016; Holden et al., 2018; Williams et al., 2019). In British Columbia, Canada, the increased maximum temperatures due to anthropogenic climate change increased burned area in 2017 to its highest extent in the 1950–2017 record, seven to eleven times the area that would have burned without climate change (Kirchmeier-Young et al., 2019). In Alaska, USA, the high maximum temperatures and extremely low relative humidity due to anthropogenic climate change accounted for 33–60% of the probability of wildfire in 2015, when the area burned was the second highest in the 1940–2015 record (Partain et al., 2016). In protected areas of Canada and the USA, climate factors (temperature, precipitation, relative humidity and evapotranspiration) accounted for 60% of burned area from local human and natural ignitions from 1984 to 2014, outweighing local human factors (population density, roads and built area) (Mansuy et al., 2019)."

Peatland area loss (shrinking) near the southern limit of their current distribution or in areas where the climate becomes unsuitable is also expected (medium evidence, medium agreement ) (Section 2.3.4.3.2) (Finkelstein and Cowling, 2011 Gallego-Sala and Prentice, 2013; Schneider et al., 2016; Müller and Joos, 2020) (Müller and Joos, 2021), but they could persist if moisture is maintained via their capacity to self-regulate. In western Canada, a study suggests that peatlands may persist until 2100, even though the climate will be less suitable (Schneider et al., 2016). Simulations suggest that climate change-driven increases in temperature and atmospheric CO2 could drive reductions in the northern peatland area up to 18% (SSP1–2.6), 41% (SSP2–4.5) and 61% (SSP5–8.5) by 2300 (Müller and Joos, 2020). This is in contrast with the findings of northern peatland persistence and expansion under RCP2.6 and RCP6.0 scenarios in 1861–2099 by another modelling study (Qiu et al., 2020). In the Tropics, the only available study suggests peatland area will increase until 2300, mainly due to increases in precipitation and the CO2 fertilisation effect (Müller and Joos, 2020; Müller and Joos, 2021)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.3.1.2_p5,Canada;Mexico;Spain;Sri Lanka,"Terrestrial and freshwater protected areas can also serve as climate change refugia, that is, locations where suitable conditions may persist for the species into the future (e.g., Section 2.6.5.6). In Canada, Mexico and the USA, only a fraction of the protected area is located in potential climate change refugia under a 4°C temperature increase, estimated at 4% (Michalak et al., 2018) to 7% (Batllori et al., 2017). Potential refugia from biome shifts due to climate change under temperature increases of 1.8°C–3.4°C cover <1% of the area of US national parks (Gonzalez et al., 2010), a fraction that diminishes to near zero when climate change is combined with habitat fragmentation due to LUC (Eigenbrod et al., 2015). Protected areas in boreal ecosystems could serve as refugia for species shifting north in Canada (Berteaux et al., 2018) and Finland (Lehikoinen et al., 2019). Invasive species, habitat loss and other disturbances in protected areas could be lower than in unprotected areas across Europe (Gallardo et al., 2017), specifically in Spain (Regos et al., 2016), and also in Sri Lanka (Kariyawasam et al., 2020). Protected areas conserve refugia from climate change under a temperature increase of 4°C, which is important for biodiversity conservation but is limited to <10% of the current protected area (medium confidence)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.3.2.2_p5,Canada,"In the Arctic tundra, boreal forests and northern peatlands, including permafrost areas, climate change under the scenario of a 4°C temperature increase could triple the burned area in Canada (Boulanger et al., 2014), double the number of fires in Finland (Lehtonen et al., 2016), increase the lightning-driven burned area by 30–250% (Veraverbeke et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2021a), push half of the area of tundra and boreal forest in Alaska above the burning threshold temperature and double the burned area in Alaska (Young et al., 2017a). Thawing of Arctic permafrost due to a projected temperature of 4°C and the resultant wildfires could release 11–200 GtC which could substantially exacerbate climate change (Section 2.5.2.9)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.3.3_p3,Canada,"Temperate and boreal forests possess greater diversity of physiological traits related to plant hydraulics, so they are more buffered against drought than tropical forests (Anderegg et al., 2018). Nevertheless, in temperate forests, drought-induced tree mortality under RCP8.5 could cause the loss of half the Northern Hemisphere conifer forest area by 2100 (McDowell et al., 2016). In the western USA, under RCP8.5, one-tenth of forest area is highly vulnerable to drought-induced mortality by 2050 (Buotte et al., 2019). In California, increased evapotranspiration in Sierra Nevada conifer forests increases the potential fraction of the area at risk of tree mortality by 15–20% per degree Celsius (Goulden and Bales, 2019). In Alaska, fire-induced tree mortality from climate change under RCP8.5 could reduce the extent of spruce forest (Picea sp.) by 8–44% by 2100 (Pastick et al., 2017). Under RCP8.5, tree mortality from drought, wildfire and bark beetles could reduce the timber productivity of boreal forests in Canada by 2100 below the current levels (Boucher et al., 2018; Chaste et al., 2019; Brecka et al., 2020). In Tasmania, projected increases in wildfire (Fox-Hughes et al., 2014) increase the risk of mortality of mesic vegetation (Harris et al., 2018b) and threaten the disappearance of the long-lived endemic pencil pine (Athrotaxis cupressoides) (Holz et al., 2015; Worth et al., 2016) and temperate montane rainforest (Mariani et al., 2019). These projections indicate risks of climate change-induced tree mortality reducing some temperate forest areas by half under emissions scenarios of 2.5°C–4°C above the pre-industrial period (medium evidence, high agreement )."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.8.4_p4,Canada;Guatemala,"Migration to cities can mean opportunities for migrants and for urban areas, but it can also worsen existing problems, as urban poor people can become even more exposed and vulnerable, and the pressure on urban capacities may not be well absorbed (high confidence) (Chisari and Miller, 2016; Gemenne et al., 2020). Internal migration to cities is likely to exacerbate pre-existing vulnerabilities related to inequality, poverty, indigence and informal activities and housing (Warn and Adamo, 2014). Immigration can make cities/residents more vulnerable to climate-change risks (Sections 12.5.5 and 12.5.7). Groups such as children, Indigenous Peoples and the poor are usually among the most vulnerable in migrations and displacements, which poses challenges to national policies and international aid (Sedeh, 2014; Gamez, 2016; Ulla, 2016; Priotto and Salvador Aruj, 2017; Ramos and de Salles Cavedon-Capdeville, 2017; Amar-Amar et al., 2019; Gemenne et al., 2020). In migration or displacement driven by climate effects, women are prone to lose their leadership, autonomy and voice, especially in new organisational structures imposed by authorities. This is especially the case in temporary accommodation camps created after disasters, exacerbating existing differentiated vulnerabilities (Aldunce Ide et al., 2020). International migration has become more dangerous and difficult as border controls have become stricter, but programmes such as one to help temporary agricultural workers from Guatemala to Canada have proven successful (Gabriel and Macdonald, 2018). At the same time, emigration may lead to the loss of IKLK for adaptation (Moreno et al., 2020b)."

Across the temperate and tropical biomes, extensive drainage and deforestation have caused widespread water table draw-downs and/or peat subsidence, as well as high CO2 emissions (medium evidence, high agreement ). Climate change is compounding these impacts (medium evidence, medium agreement ). For example, in Indonesia, the highest emissions from drained tropical peatlands were reported in the extremely dry year of the 1997 El Niño (810–2570 TgC yr -1) (Page et al., 2002) and the 2015 fire season (380 TgC yr -1) (Field et al., 2016). These prolonged dry seasons have also led to tree die-offs and fires, which are relatively new phenomena at these latitudes (medium evidence, high agreement ) (Cole et al., 2015; Mezbahuddin et al., 2015; Fanin and van der Werf, 2017; Taufik et al., 2017; Cole et al., 2019). Low soil moisture contributes to increased fire propagation (Section 12.4.2.2) (Dadap et al., 2019; Canadell et al., 2021), causing long-lasting fires responsible for smoke and haze pollution (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Ballhorn et al., 2009; Page et al., 2009; Gaveau et al., 2014; Huijnen et al., 2016; Page and Hooijer, 2016; Hu et al., 2018; Vadrevu et al., 2019; Niwa et al., 2021). Increases in fires and smoke lead to habitat loss and negatively impact regional faunal populations (limited evidence, high agreement ) (Neoh et al., 2015; Erb et al., 2018b; Thornton et al., 2018)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.4.2.3_p7,Indonesia,"In Indonesia, deforestation and draining of peat swamp forests dries out the peat, providing substantial fuel for fires (Page and Hooijer, 2016). Extreme fire years in Indonesia, including 1997, 2006 and 2015, coincided with extreme heat and aridity during the warm phase of the ENSO (Field et al., 2016). Fire-resistant forest in 2019 covered only 3% of peatlands and 4.5% of non-peatlands on Sumatra and Kalimantan (Nikonovas et al., 2020)."

Arctic permafrost contains 1400 ± 200 GtC to a depth of 3 m, the largest soil carbon stock in the world (Hugelius et al., 2014). Globally, peatlands contain 470–620 GtC (Page et al., 2011; Hodgkins et al., 2018), of which boreal and temperate peatlands contain 415 ± 150 GtC (Hugelius et al., 2020) and tropical peatlands contain 80–350 GtC (Page et al., 2011; Dargie et al., 2017; Gumbricht et al., 2017; Ribeiro et al., 2021).

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.5.10_p4,Indonesia,"Improving the resilience of SEA peatlands to fire and climate change through restoration is extremely difficult and presents many challenges. The Indonesian government has tasked the Badan Restorasi Gambut (Peatland Restoration Agency) to restore peatlands (Darusman et al., 2021; Giesen, 2021). Other local initiatives exist, such as fire management programmes and restoration projects (Puspitaloka et al., 2020). Since 2016, the government of Indonesia has re-wetted ~380,000 hectares of degraded peatlands, mainly by blocking canals and flooding, but less than 2000 hectares have been successfully restored to sustaining native plant species common to peat swamp forests (Giesen, 2021). Replanting native trees has had relatively little success (Lampela et al., 2017) because such trees have low tolerance to prolonged inundation and no fire adaptation strategies (Page et al., 2009; Roucoux et al., 2013; Dohong et al., 2018; Cole et al., 2019; Luom, 2020; Giesen, 2021)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.6_p4,Indonesia,"While the science of restoration has generated many successes, some habitats are very difficult to restore, making certain decisions effectively irreversible. For example, Acacia nilotica was introduced into Indonesia in the 1850s for gum arabic, with planting expanded for fire breaks in the 1960s. This tree became invasive and has already replaced >50% of the savanna habitat in the Baluran National Park, with complete replacement expected in the near future. This shift from savanna to acacia forest is causing large declines in native species, including the charismatic wild banteng, Bos javanicus, and the wild dog (dhole, Cuon alpinus) (Caesariantika et al., 2011; Padmanaba et al., 2017; Zahra et al., 2020). Multiple approaches to controlling the spread of this acacia have been ineffective, highlighting the difficulty of reversing the decision to plant this tree (Zahra et al., 2020). Another example is the difficulties in restoring the tropical peat forests of SEA (Section 2.6.5.10)."

The net health benefits of controlling air pollution as part of climate mitigation efforts could reach trillions of dollars annually, depending on the air quality policies adopted globally (Markandya et al. 2018; Scovronick et al. 2019b). Air pollution reductions resulting from meeting the Paris Agreement targets were estimated to provide health co-benefits-to-mitigation ratios of between 1.4 and 2.5 (Markandya et al. 2018). In Asia, the benefit of air pollution reduction through mitigation measures was estimated to reduce premature mortality by 0.79 million, with an associated health benefit of USD2.8 trillion versus mitigation costs of USD840 billion, equating to 6% and 2% of GDP, respectively (Xie et al. 2018). Similarly, stabilising radiative forcing to 3.4 W m –2 in South Korea could cost USD1.3–8.5 billion in 2050 and could lead to a USD23.5 billion cost reduction from the combined benefits of avoided premature mortality, health expenditures, and lost work hours (Kim et al. 2020). The health co-benefits related to physical exercise and reduced air pollution largely offset the costs of implementing low-CO2-emitting urban mobility strategies in three Austrian cities (Wolkinger et al. 2018)."

Many cities facing frequent heavy storms that impact mostly underprivileged communities, slums and vulnerable areas could benefit from integrated NbS for disaster risk reduction and adaptation (high confidence) (Sandholz et al., 2018; Ronchi and Arcidiacono, 2019). A study covering 70 Latin American cities estimated that 96 million people would benefit from improving main watersheds with GI (Tellman et al., 2018). In several municipal climate plans, NbSs were introduced mainly to enhance rainwater management, reduce energy consumption and urban heat areas, improve water quality, prevent landslides and set aside green areas (high confidence) (Gobierno de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires, 2015; Municipio del Distrito Metropolitano de Quito, 2020; Prefeitura Municipal de Curitiba, 2020; Alcaldía de Medellín, 2021; Municipalidad de Lima, 2021; Prefeitura da Cidade do Rio de Janeiro, 2021; Prefeitura do Município de São Paulo, 2021). São Paulo’s project for Jaguaré River proposes a large-scale landscape transformation applying innovative multi-functional NbSs instead of exclusively large, expensive and monofunctional hard-engineered solutions to manage stormwater (Marques et al., 2018; Herzog and Rozado, 2019). In Bogota, the Humedales Foundation has restored wetlands to enhance areas near the Van Der Hammen reserve to improve water quality and quantity, restore habitat for biodiversity and provide flood protection (Portugal Del Pino et al., 2020). In Petrópolis, a medium-sized city in the hills of Rio de Janeiro state, the water service company has implemented 10 NbS multi-functional micro wastewater treatment plants in low-income areas, helping to reduce cascading impacts of storms, floods and epidemics (Herzog and Rozado, 2019). In Costanera Sur, Buenos Aires, a public initiative to protect an auto-regenerated River Plate bank, which had received demolition material to create land, currently offers numerous ecosystem services for residents and attract visitors, activating the tourist industry and helping reducing riverine floods (Bertonatti, 2021; OICS, 2021)."

In this chapter, we refer to this sub-region as CA because it excludes southern Mexico. The climate-change literature for the region occasionally includes Mexico, and in those cases, our assessment makes reference to Latin America but when only southern Mexico is included, the term Mesoamerica is used.

A significant reduction in net primary productivity in tropical forests is expected under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 as a result of temperature increase, precipitation reduction and droughts (Lyra et al., 2017; Castro et al., 2018; Stan et al., 2020). Aridity index models show that the dry, sub-humid vegetation of the dry corridor will expand to neighbouring areas and replace the humid forests in the Pacific lowlands and the northern parts of Guatemala by 2050 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios (Pons et al., 2018; CEPAL and CAC-SICA, 2020). A warming of 3°C would shrink the tropical rainforest and replace it with savannah grassland.

Protected area in CSA are underfunded (very high confidence). Latin American (including Mexico) governments allocate just about 1% of their national environmental budgets on protected areas (about USD 1.18 ha −1 on average). This figure only covers 54% of their basic needs, resulting in insufficient management. The financing gap to achieve optimal needs for protected areas in CSA is approximately USD 700 million yr −1 (Bovarnick et al., 2010). This seriously compromises the management and delivery capacity of protected areas for climate-change adaptation and preparedness for ongoing ecological transformation (van Kerkhoff et al., 2019). Furthermore, to become a relevant mechanism for resilience, protected areas need to be managed for this purpose (Mansourian et al., 2009). About 40% of protected areas in Latin America and the Caribbean (including Mexico) have undertaken management effectiveness evaluations (UNEP-WCMC and IUCN, 2020a). This is hardly representative of Aichi’s Target 11, although far better than the 11% global average. Collaborations with Indigenous Peoples and local communities are also an important issue to consolidate protected areas (Gross et al., 2016). In addition to protected areas as solutions for climate-change adaptation and mitigation, there is also a need to protect or restore ecosystems outside the protected areas, as illustrated by the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (Imbach et al., 2013)."

Those poverty and extreme poverty rates are higher among children, young people, women, Indigenous Peoples (Reckien et al., 2017; Busso and Messina, 2020), migrants (Dodman et al., 2019) and rural populations.

Early protection of peat forests has been highlighted as a more effective management strategy than restoration, not only on islands in SEA but also in areas like Papua New Guinea, which may be targeted for the expansion of estate crop plantations (Neuzil et al., 1997; Dennis, 1999; Anshari et al., 2001; Anshari et al., 2004; Hooijer et al., 2006; Heil et al., 2007; Page et al., 2009; Page et al., 2011; Posa et al., 2011; Miettinen et al., 2012; Wetlands International, 2012; Biagioni et al., 2015; Miettinen et al., 2016; Rieley and Page, 2016; Adila et al., 2017; Cole et al., 2019; Vetrita and Cochrane, 2019; Harrison et al., 2020; Hoyt et al., 2020; Ruwaimana et al., 2020; Ward et al., 2020; Cole et al., 2021)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.6.1_p5,Guinea,"The second highlighted initiative is the AGRUPAR (Participatory Urban Agriculture) programme, launched as a public initiative in 2002 initially with international cooperation funds. It was aimed at providing assistance to poorer urban and peri-urban populations, to initiate and manage orchards as well as domestic animals such as chickens and guinea pigs, with the goal of promoting self-sustenance and commerce. AGRUPAR provides and finances training, seeds and seedlings, greenhouses, certifications and marketing support and spaces where farmers can sell directly their products to consumers. In 2016, AGRUPAR gave assistance to more than 4000 farmers managing orchards of various scales that combined produce, more than 500 tonnes annually. The programme has direct impacts on nutrition, generation of work for women, production of healthy food, reduction of runoff, recycling of organic waste and social cohesion, among others (very high confidence)  (Thomas, 2014; Cuvi, 2015; Rodríguez-Dueñas and Rivera, 2016; Clavijo Palacios and Cuvi, 2017)."

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.1_p2,Spain,"None of the evolutionary changes either documented or theorised would enable a species to survive and reproduce in climate spaces that it does not already inhabit. It is very improbable that evolutionary responses would be sufficient to prevent species extinctions in the case of that species losing its climate space entirely on a regional or global scale (section 2.4.2.8) (Parmesan and Hanley, 2015). At the highest risk are the world’s most cold-adapted species (whose habitats are restricted to polar and high mountain-top areas). Examples include the polar bear (Regehr et al., 2016), ‘sky-island’ plants in the Tropics (Kidane et al., 2019), mountain-top amphibians in Spain (Enriquez-Urzelai et al., 2019), mountain-top lichens in the Appalachians (USA) (Allen and Lendemer, 2016) and silverswords in Hawaii (Krushelnycky et al., 2013). However, there is potential for using evolutionary changes to enhance the adaptive capacity of target species, as is being done on the Great Barrier Reef by translocating symbionts and corals that have survived recent intense heat-induced bleaching events into areas that have had large die-off (Rinkevich, 2019). Multiple studies have assessed when and how evolution might be able to help wild species adapt to climate change (Ratnam et al., 2011; Sgro et al., 2011)."

While this extreme fire year coincided with the highest daily mean maximum temperature in the period 1979–2017 (Bowman et al., 2019) in central Chile (the area of highest fire activity), burned area from 1976 to 2013 showed the highest correlation with the precipitation cycles of the ENSO and the temperature cycles of the Antarctic Oscillation (Urrutia-Jalabert et al., 2018)."

Droughts in SWS are a major threat to water security (high confidence) (Aitken et al., 2016; Núñez et al., 2017) as river streamflows are highly dependent on the interannual to decadal climate conditions, snow melting processes and rainfall events (Boisier et al., 2016) and impacted by land uses and changes in irrigated agriculture (medium confidence: medium evidence, high agreement ) (Vicuña et al., 2013; Fuentes et al., 2021)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.3.7.3_p6,Chile,"Chile has experienced accelerated economic growth, which has reduced poverty; however, important geographical, economic and educational inequalities remain (Repetto, 2016). The Chilean healthcare system has become more equitable and responsive to the population’s needs (e.g., the Bono AUGE healthcare reform programme); however, the high relative inequalities in terms of income (OECD, 2018), education level and rural–urban factors are determinants of quality of care, health system barriers and differential access to healthcare (high confidence) (Frenz et al., 2014). Exposure and vulnerability to psychosocial risks in SWS show significant inequalities in times of disasters such as earthquakes according to socioeconomic, geographic and gender factors (high confidence) (Labra, 2002; Vitriol et al., 2014; Quijada et al., 2018), which are increased by the absence of local planning and drills and the lack of coordination (Vitriol et al., 2014).

Ocean and coastal ecosystems in SWS are sensitive to upwelling intensity, which affects the abundance, diversity, physiology and survivorship of coastal species (high confidence) (Anabalón et al., 2016; Jacob et al., 2018; Ramajo et al., 2020) (Figure 12.8). Increasing radiation and temperatures and reduced precipitation, in conjunction with increased nutrient load, have increased HAB events, producing massive fauna mortalities (high confidence) (León-Muñoz et al., 2018; IPCC, 2019b, SPM A8.2 and B8.3; Quiñones et al., 2019; Soto et al., 2019; Armijo et al., 2020).

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.3.7.4_p8,Chile,"SWS cities have been largely impacted by wildfires, water scarcity and landslides affecting highways and local roads, as well as potable water supply (Sepúlveda et al., 2015; Araya-Muñoz et al., 2016 ). Increasing temperature and heat extreme events in cities have increased the demand for water, damage to urban infrastructure (Monsalves-Gavilán et al., 2013) and accelerated ageing and death of trees (high confidence) (Moser-Reischl et al., 2019). Increasing temperature will modify energy demand in cities in northern and central Chile (Rouault et al., 2019)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.3.8.1_p1,Chile,"There were inconsistent trends and insufficient data coverage on extreme temperatures and precipitation (low confidence), but an increase in the frequency of meteorological droughts was observed with medium confidence (Dereczynski et al., 2020; Dunn et al., 2020; WGI AR6 Tables 11.13, 11.14, 11.15, Seneviratne et al., 2021; WGI AR6 Table 12.3, Ranasinghe et al., 2021). An increase in precipitation in Trelew, no change for Comodoro Rivadavia, both stations located in eastern Patagonia, and negative trends in austral summer rainfall in the southern Andes were observed (Vera and Díaz, 2015; Saurral et al., 2017). Chile’s wildfires in Patagonia (fire frequency and intensity) have grown at an alarming rate (Úbeda and Sarricolea, 2016). Decreasing rainfall patterns in Punta Arenas is closely associated with variability at interannual to inter-decadal time scales of the main forcing system of climate in Patagonia. Snow cover extension (SCE) and snow cover duration decreased by an average of approximately 13 ± 2% and 43 ± 20 d respectively from 2000 to 2016, due to warming rather than drying (Rasmussen et al., 2007). In particular, analysis of spatial patterns of SCE indicates a slightly greater reduction on the eastern side (approximately 14 ± 2%) of the Andes Cordillera compared to the western side (approximately 12 ± 3%). According to the longest time series of glacier mass balance data in the Southern Hemisphere, the Echaurren Norte glacier lost 65% of its original area in the period 1955–2015 and disaggregated into two ice bodies in the late 1990s (Malmros et al., 2018; Pérez et al., 2018)."

In Chile, for example, the Eco-social Observatory of Climate Change Effects for High Altitude Wetlands of Tarapacá has been collecting information on physical, biological and social variables since 2013 (Uribe Rivera et al., 2017). Other examples in the Andes are the GLORIA-Andes network (Cuesta et al., 2017a), the Andean Forest Network (Malizia et al., 2020) and the Initiative of Hydrological Monitoring in the Andes (IMHEA), with measures to optimise watershed management and protection and reduce the risk of water insecurity (Correa et al., 2020)."

Fisheries and aquaculture contribute significantly to food security and livelihoods by creating employment (more than two million people), income and economic growth for the region (Section 3.5; FAO, 2018). More than 45% of the total fisheries in CSA are based on marine products (CEPALSTAT, 2019). Peru, Chile, Argentina and Ecuador are among the 15 countries with the largest marine capture production worldwide (Gutiérrez et al., 2016a; FAO, 2018; Vannuccini et al., 2018), while more than 90% of the hydrological resources produced by aquaculture in CSA have a marine origin (CEPALSTAT, 2019). There is high confidence about important current and future impacts of climate-change hazards in marine resources used by fisheries; however, there is low evidence regarding impacts on regional economies (Figure 12.9, 12.10; Table SM12.3)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.2.2_p3,Chile,"There is low evidence whether the establishment of MPAs and the creation of legal instruments have allowed the development of new research activities have increased the environmental awareness, decreased the illegal extraction, and improved the local coordination which have promoted the sustainable use of marine resources, and improved the community-government cooperation in marine ecosystems (Alvarado et al., 2017). The experience in countries like Chile demonstrates the importance of implementing robust management plans that guarantee the protection objectives and the sustainability through the implementation of EbA measures such as MPAs (Petit et al., 2018)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.3.1_p4,Chile;Peru;Guatemala;Colombia,"Risks of water scarcity and flood threaten people unevenly across the region. In CSA, about 26% (130 million people) of the population have no access to safe drinking water, and strong disparities prevail regarding its spatial distribution; for example, in Chile, 99% of the population have access, compared to 50% in Peru, 73% in Colombia, 52% in Nicaragua or 56% in Guatemala (high confidence) (UNICEF and WHO, 2019). Inequalities can be further exacerbated by unregulated or privately owned water rights and allocation systems (e.g., in Chile) (Muñoz et al., 2020a). The most vulnerable people belong to low-income groups in rural areas and informal settlements of large urban areas (high confidence) (WWAP, 2020)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.3.2_p3,Chile;Peru,"Major emphasis has been placed on NbS, that is, catchment interventions that are inspired and supported by nature and leverage natural processes and ecosystem services to contribute to the improved management of water. NbS potentially enhance water infiltration, groundwater recharge and surface storage, contribute to disaster risk reduction and can replace or complement grey (i.e., conventionally built) infrastructure that is often socioenvironmentally contested (WWAP, 2018). Some examples include the reactivation of ancestral infiltration enhancement systems in the Peruvian Andes (NWS) (Ochoa-Tocachi et al., 2019), the use of erosion control structures in the Bolivian Altiplano (SAM) (Hartman et al., 2016) and the potential improvement of drinking water quality and flood risk reduction in urban areas of CSA (Tellman et al., 2018) (Section 12.5.5.3.2). Additionally, NbS in combination with ecosystem and community-based adaptation potentially generate important co-benefits, including increasing water security and the attenuation of social conflicts in Chile (SWS) (Reid et al., 2018), water conservation in coastal Peru (NWS) and flood protection in Guyana (NSA) (medium confidence: medium evidence, medium agreement ) (Spencer et al., 2017). However, the evaluation of implementation success of NbS is often hampered by limited evidence on actual benefits (WWAP, 2018)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.3.3_p1,Chile;Peru;Ecuador;Colombia;Argentina;Venezuela,"National policies on climate change, water protection, regulation and management laws are important focal areas of adaptation in the water sector (Section 4.7). Notable in the jurisdiction field is the Glacier Protection Law in place in Argentina (2010–2019) and under construction in Chile (since 2005). This first glacier law in the world represents a milestone for high-mountain conservation but is also criticised for hindering effective disaster risk adaptation measures and excluding local socioeconomic needs (Anacona et al., 2018). Furthermore, the first Framework Law on Climate Change was implemented in Peru (2018) and is under way in Colombia, Chile and Venezuela (Figure 12.13; Table SM12.6). Overarching regional institutions (e.g., OAS [2016])  and most countries in CSA promote a move towards more integrative and sustainable management of water resources through new legislation and financing mechanisms. For instance, new water laws that include principles of integrated water resource management (IWRM) have entered into force, for example, in Nicaragua (2007), Peru (2009), Ecuador (2014) and Costa Rica (2014), or are under way, such as in Colombia (since 2009). However, current realities in all regions show major challenges in implementing IWRM mechanisms and policies, related but not limited to political and institutional instabilities, governance structures, fragmented service provision, lack of economies of scale and scope, corruption and social conflicts (high confidence) (WWAP, 2020)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.3.4_p3,Chile;Venezuela,"Most barriers to advance adaptation in CSA correspond to soft limits associated with missing links of science–society–policy processes, institutional fragilities, pronounced hierarchies, unequal power relations and top-down water governance regimes (high confidence). One example is the abandonment of long-term hydrological monitoring sites within tropical Andean ecosystems (paramo) in Venezuela (Rodríguez-Morales et al., 2019) due to the lack of governmental support during the political crisis. In that regard, the collection and availability of consistent hydroclimatic and socioeconomic data at adequate scales represent an important challenge in CSA. Major adaptation barriers are furthermore reported from central Chile in the context of a mega-drought since 2010, related to socioeconomic factors and a deficient bottom-up approach to informing and developing public policy (Aldunce et al., 2017). These gaps could be bridged by strengthening transdisciplinary approaches at the science–policy interface (Lillo-Ortega et al., 2019) with blended bottom-up and top-down adaptation to include scientific knowledge with impact and scenario assessments in local adaptation agendas (Huggel et al., 2015b). For instance, a new allocation rule for the Laja reservoir in southern Chile (SWS), based on consistent water balance modelling results, could inform policy and water management and potentially improve local water management and reduce water conflicts over the long term (Muñoz et al., 2019b)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.5.2_p2,Chile,"Lima’s Climate Action Strategy is an example (Metropolitan Municipality of Lima, 2014). It was approved following a participatory and consultative process with the technical group on climate change from the Metropolitan Environmental Commission, focusing on the reduction of water vulnerabilities to drought and heavy rain, on the basis of which 10 (out of 51 with Callao) Lima district municipalities are developing and starting to implement adaptation measures (Foro Ciudades Para la Vida, 2021). In 2021 the municipality of Lima also approved its Local Climate Change Plan (Metropolitan Municipality of Lima, 2021) under a similar process. The engagement of local players was central to spreading and mobilising different types of knowledge and creating networks able to support adaptation (Section 12.6.3; Miranda Sara and Baud, 2014; Miranda Sara et al., 2017). The inclusive process is also a goal based on the example of Chile Municipalities Network Facing Climate Change (RedMuniCC) engaged in developing participatory strategic plans for climate adaptation and mitigation (RedMuniCC, 2021)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.8.2_p2,Chile,"Perceptions tend to be different in rural and urban areas (Sherman et al., 2015). In rural areas, it largely relates to temperature rise and changes in rainfall patterns, changes in agriculture (pests, calendars), biodiversity loss, solar radiation or changes in the oceans, and their impacts are sometimes related or even more attributed to socioeconomic and environmental drivers, as well as to negative financial outcomes (high confidence) (Infante and Infante, 2013; Postigo, 2014; Jacobi et al., 2015; Barrucand et al., 2017; Harvey et al., 2018; Martins and Gasalla, 2018; Meldrum et al., 2018; Córdoba Vargas et al., 2019; Leroy, 2019; Viguera et al., 2019; Gutierrez et al., 2020; Iniguez-Gallardo et al., 2020; Lambert and Eise, 2020). In such places as Amazonia, perception increases with age (Funatsu et al., 2019). In Mediterranean Chile, younger, more educated producers and those who own their land tend to have clearer perceptions than older, less educated or tenant farmers, but they do not have a clear perception or how it may affect their yields and farming operation (Roco et al., 2015). In some dry and humid Ecuadorian montane forests, peasantss perceptions are in line with the scientific data, but they have a lot of difficulties to predict the changes and believe that they may not be prepared and can only be reactive (Herrador-Valencia and Paredes, 2016). In an Andean community, perceptions of climate change are homogeneous and do not vary according to gender, age or ethnicity (Cáceres-Arteaga et al., 2020). Among representatives of five municipalities of Lima, it was found that climate change is not well understood and residents have trouble distinguishing it from other environmental issues (Siña et al., 2016). In an Amazonian region, farmers provided a more accurate description than regional institutions of how it affects the local livelihood system (Altea, 2020). In Cuenca Auqui peasants attribute recently experienced challenges in agricultural production mainly to perceived changes in precipitation patterns, but statistical analyses of daily precipitation records at nearby stations do not corroborate those perceived changes (Gurgiser et al., 2016)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.8.3_p2,Chile,"However, women are not always the more vulnerable group. While in a broad sense climate-change impacts women more severely, there are situations where they have reacted, adapted better to or been more resilient. Grassroots women self-help groups can be active agents of change for their communities, designing and delivering gender-responsive adaptation solutions (Huairou Commission, 2019). Some studies suggest that women establish friendlier relationships with the environment and towards natural resources; studies on masculinity and environment confirm this tendency (Brough et al., 2016). In a multi-country study, some female-headed households tend to be slightly less vulnerable and more resilient than male-headed households, though some exceptions were found among sub-groups (Andersen et al., 2017). In Chile, women are more likely to modernise irrigation and infrastructure, and gender appears to be an important element in drought adaptation (Roco et al., 2016). A change to agroecological practices has improved gender equality and adaptive capacity to climate change (Cáceres-Arteaga et al., 2020)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#FAQ 12.5_p6,Chile;Guatemala,"The traditional agriculture of Mapuche Indigenous Peoples in Chile includes a series of practices that result in a system that is more resilient to climate and non-climate stressors.

While biodiversity and several ecosystem services can be considered synergistic (food webs, tourism and of aesthetic and spiritual value) (Langhans et al., 2019), others can be considered antagonistic in case of a strong ecosystem service demand (such as water abstraction, water use and food security in terms of overexploitation). Here, the balance between biodiversity and ecosystem services is key (Langhans et al., 2019), where biodiversity can be integrated into water policy by means of integrated water resource management (IWRM) towards NbS (Ligtvoet et al., 2017)"

Existing protected areas in Thailand cover approximately 21% of the land area and it is one of the few tropical countries that has achieved the Aichi Target 11. Most protected areas in Thailand were established on an ad hoc basis to protect remaining forest cover and, as a result, they do not represent diverse habitats and their associated species (Chutipong et al., 2014; Tantipisanuh, 2016) so they may not be resilient to the interacting impacts of future land use and climate change (Klorvuttimontara et al., 2011; Trisurat, 2018)."

Results, based on a spatial distribution model and network flow, determined there was a need for expansion areas of 5,200 km 2 in size, or 3% of the region, to substantially minimise the high level of risk and increase the average coping capacity of the protection of suitable habitats from 82%—the current plan—to 90%. These results were adopted by Thailand’s Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation, and included in the National Wildlife Administration and Conservation Plan for 2021–2031."

There is increasing evidence that climate warming has extended the elevational distribution of Anopheles, Culex and Aedes mosquito vectors above 2000 m in Nepal (limited evidence, high agreement ) (Dahal, 2008; Dhimal et al., 2014a; Dhimal et al., 2014b; Dhimal et al., 2015), with similar trends being recorded in neighbouring Himalayan regions (medium evidence, high agreement ) (Phuyal et al., 2020; Dhimal et al., 2021). Host animals in novel areas may be immunologically naive, and therefore more vulnerable to severe illness (Bradley et al., 2005; Hall et al., 2016)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#FAQ 2.2_p4,Nepal,"Climate change further increases risk by altering pathogen and host animal (1) geographic ranges and habitats; (2) survival, growth and development; (3) reproduction and replication; (4) transmission and exposure (5) behaviour; and (6) access to immunologically naïve animals and people who lack resistance to infection. This can lead to novel disease emergence in new places, more frequent and larger outbreaks, and longer or shifted seasons of transmission. Climate change is making it possible for many EIDs to colonise historically colder areas that are becoming warmer and wetter in temperate and polar regions and in the mountains. Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are diseases spread by vectors such as mosquitoes, sand flies, kissing bugs and ticks. For example, ticks that carry the virus that causes tick-borne encephalitis have moved into the northern subarctic regions of Asia and Europe. Viruses like dengue, chikungunya and Japanese encephalitis are emerging in Nepal in hilly and mountainous areas. Novel outbreaks of Vibrio bacteria seafood poisoning are being traced to the the Baltic States and Alaska where they were never documented before. Many scientific studies show that the transmission of infectious disease and the number of individuals infected depends on rainfall and temperature; climate change often makes these conditions more favourable for disease transmission."

However, tree line behaviours are diverse. A study in Nepal recorded that the tree line fomed by Abies spectabilis had been stable for more than a century, while the upper limit of large shrubs (Rhododendron campanulatum) had been advancing (Mainali et al., 2020). In both the Andes (Harsch et al., 2009) and Himalayas (Singh et al., 2021), most tree lines have been stable, leading (Rehm and Feeley, 2015) to postulate a ‘grass ceiling’ that has been difficult for trees to penetrate. The tree line shifts that have occurred are probably driven by interactions between changing land use (e.g., fire suppression) and climate changes such as increased rainfall, warming and elevated CO2 (via CO2 fertilisation or increases in water-use efficiency) (medium evidence, medium agreement ) (Cernusak et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2013; Van Der Sleen et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2016)."

In Peru, montane ice-field meltwater provides 80% of the water resources for the arid coast where half the population lives (Thompson et al., 2021). Increasing variability of precipitation has compromised rain-fed agriculture and power generation, particularly in the dry season, exacerbating pressures for new sources of water (Bradley et al., 2006; Bury et al., 2013; Buytaert et al., 2017).

In Peru alone, wet extremes are estimated to be at least 1.5 times more likely to happen compared to pre-industrial times. The extremely wet ENSO event of 2017 resulted in 6–9 billion USD in monetary losses in that country, 1.7 million inhabitants affected and crops, roads, bridges, homes, schools and health service facilities damaged or destroyed. Distinct types of ENSO events can have differentiated impacts (French and Mechler, 2017; Christidis et al., 2019; Takahashi and Martínez, 2019; Bertrand et al., 2020; Coayla and Culqui, 2020)."

ENSO events have been related to such diseases as dengue and leptospirosis (Quintero-Herrera et al., 2015; Sánchez et al., 2017; Arias-Monsalve and Builes-Jaramillo, 2019); they can also lead to an increased incidence of chikungunya (Sections 7.2.2.1 and 7.3.1.3). Precipitation, relative humidity and temperature have influenced dengue incidence in recent years (Mattar et al., 2013) (Table 12.1). Dengue cases are predicted to increase in the 1.5°C and the 3.7°C warming scenarios by 2050 and 2100, with increases ranging from 28,900 to 88,800 in Peru, 34,600 to 110,000 in Ecuador, and 97,400 to 317,000 in Colombia, although these scenarios do not consider the potential effects of vaccines or socioeconomic trajectories (Colón-González et al., 2018). Other studies found that Aedes aegypti (arbovirus vector) will shift into higher elevations, increasing the populations at risk (Figure 12.5) (Lippi et al., 2019). Climate change will contribute to increased malaria vectorial capacity (high confidence) (Section 7.2.2.1) (Laporta et al., 2015). Increases in minimum temperature were associated with historical malaria transmission when taking into consideration disease control interventions and climate factors (Fletcher et al., 2020). Figure 12.4 shows mixed changes in the number of months suitable for malaria transmission, with low-lying areas in coastal regions becoming more suitable.

New lakes represent a source of future hazards and water scarcity, as well as opportunities to serve as water reservoirs (Colonia et al., 2017; Drenkhan et al., 2019). The timing and extent of peak water due to glacier shrinkage is spatially highly variable and has passed for a large number of tropical Andes glaciers (Hock et al., 2019). Cities dependent on glacier melt have experienced high variability in domestic water supply (Chevallier et al., 2011; Soruco et al., 2015; Mark et al., 2017), as shown in Case Study 2.7.3, but an increase in demand may also have an effect (Buytaert and De Bièvre, 2012).

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.1.3_p5,Peru,"There is an ecosystem bias in adaptation priorities for research and implementation, hindering the development of comprehensive adaptation programmes. Most scientific research on adaptation in Peru focuses on the highlands and coastal regions, while mitigation research focuses on forests (Chazarin et al., 2014). Combined adaptation and mitigation strategies can produce positive results, but they are often disconnected (Locatelli et al., 2015). Most reviewed cases in agriculture and forestry in Latin America (84% of 274 cases) reported positive synergies between adaptation and mitigation.

Adaptation strategies could benefit from integrating these and other insights from traditional cultures, fostering risk reduction and transformational adaptation towards intrinsically sustainable systems (medium confidence: medium evidence, high agreement ) (Walshe and Argumedo, 2016)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.3.2_p2,Peru;Ecuador;Colombia,"Most adaptive water management approaches in CSA centre around extending the water supply side, including large infrastructure projects. However, ‘hard path’ interventions are now strongly contested because negative effects exacerbate local water conflicts (Carey et al., 2012; Boelens et al., 2019; Drenkhan et al., 2019), potentially leading to increasing water demand, vulnerabilities and water shortage risks (Di Baldassarre et al., 2018), thereby limiting adaptive capacity (high confidence) (Ochoa-Tocachi et al., 2019). More integrated approaches focus on multiple uses of water storage with shared stakeholder vision, responsibilities, rights and costs, as well as risks and benefits, and often integrating water and risk management (Branche, 2017; Haeberli et al., 2017; Drenkhan et al., 2019). In this chapter, a feasibility assessment was carried out for six major dimensions of multi-use water storage for the entire CSA (Table 12.11). While geophysical and economic aspects allow for the implementation of water storage projects under a multi-use approach, the institutional, social and environmental dimensions pose a major barrier (Section 12.5.3). Further demand-oriented approaches focus on incentives for the reduction of water use through changes in people’s habits, efficiency increase and smart water management (Gleick, 2002). These are promoted in some regions, such as in CA and NWS (e.g., Colombia, Ecuador and Peru), to foster a sustainable water culture (Bremer et al., 2016; Paerregaard et al., 2016)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.3.2_p4,Peru,"In recent years, the inclusion of IKLK in current adaptation baselines has attracted increasing attention, particularly in regions with a high share of Indigenous Peoples (NWS, SAN, SWS, NSA) (high confidence) (Reyes-García et al., 2016; Schoolmeester et al., 2018; McDowell et al., 2019). One example is the adapted use of agrobiodiversity when dealing with more frequent and intense tidal floods in the Amazon delta (NSA) (Vogt et al., 2016). In another context, IKLK has been considered for the evaluation of water scarcity and GLOF risks in Peru (NWS) (Motschmann et al., 2020b). Additionally, local citizen science-based initiatives (Buytaert et al., 2014; Tellman et al., 2016; Njue et al., 2019) can support the production of multiple forms of knowledge with flexible and extensive data collection. Important questions centre around how to integrate IKLK and other types of knowledge from the early planning stages on, to achieve enhanced or transformational adaptation building on co-produced knowledge (Kates et al., 2012; Klenk et al., 2017). NbS combined with community engagement and integration of diverse knowledge can foster transformational adaptation of social-ecological systems (Palomo et al., 2021)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.3.4_p1,Peru;Ecuador,"Although a growing body of adaptation initiatives exists for CSA, evidence on their effectiveness is scarce. In many parts of CSA the level of success of adaptation measures depends largely on the governance of projects and stakeholder-based processes and is closely related to their effectiveness, efficiency, social equity and sociopolitical legitimacy (high confidence) (Adger et al., 2005; Rasmussen, 2016b; Moulton et al., 2021). Several PES experiences across CSA have been described as successful measures for watershed conservation and adaptation (high confidence). An example of success is the Quito water fund in Ecuador, which aims to improve the city’s water quality by integrating public and private stakeholder interests with ecosystem conservation and local community development since the 2000s (Bremer et al., 2016; Grima et al., 2016) (Case Study 12.6.1). At the same time, in Moyobamba in Peru, the development of a watershed protection programme was leveraged by a multi-stakeholder platform process that enabled deep social learning (Lindsay, 2018). In turn, initiatives that do not consider the entire set of social-ecological dimensions and dynamics of adaptation or unintentionally increase vulnerabilities of human or natural systems are at risk of leading to reduced outcomes (McDowell et al., 2021) or maladaptation (Reid et al., 2018; McDowell et al., 2019; Eriksen et al., 2021). However, systematic assessments of maladaptation in the water sector have barely been provided for CSA."

Systems for measuring, reporting and verifying adaptation financing, as in Colombia (Guzmán et al., 2018), or a national legislation geared towards adaptation, can also help access funds. The Peruvian Law on the Retribution Mechanism of Eco-Systemic Services and Code (Miranda Sara and Baud, 2014; MINAM Peru, 2016) in addition to the Ley Marco de la Gestión y Prestación de los Servicios de Saneamiento and Its Code (Ministerio de Vivienda, Construcción y Saneamiento de Perú, 2017), allowed potable water companies to add 1% to the bill to guarantee ecosystem services, water treatment and reuse with GI.

It can also feed into an EWS, particularly if the data are compatible in format and spatiotemporal scales. An integrated climate–health surveillance system for vector-borne disease control was developed in southern coastal Ecuador through a partnership among the climate and health sectors and academia (Borbor-Cordova et al., 2016; Lowe et al., 2017). Additionally, an interdisciplinary multi-national team working at the border of Ecuador and Peru created a cooperation network for climate-informed dengue surveillance (Quichi et al., 2016), and their successful binational collaboration resulted in the local elimination of malaria (Krisher et al., 2016).

Exceptions include Bolivia, whose NDC developed the ‘good life’ concept as an alternative development pathway, supporting sustainable livelihoods as a means to eradicate poverty. Honduras asserts that climate action should improve living conditions. Peru defined a poverty and vulnerability reduction approach. Finally, El Salvador conditioned its NDCs to macroeconomic stability, economic growth and poverty reduction. A sustainable development approach permeates the proposed actions for sectors such as energy, agriculture, transport, water and forestry."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.8.4_p3,Peru;Ecuador,"Migration most often originates in rural areas, with people moving to other rural or urban areas within their home countries (Table Cross-Chapter Box MIGRATE 1 in Chapter 7). In the Amazon, approximately 80% of the population are concentrated in cities due to rural–urban migrations in search of better income, livelihoods and services, in cases associated with extreme floods and droughts (Pinho et al., 2015). In Ecuador, environmental variables are most likely to enhance international than internal migration (Gray and Bilsborrow, 2013). Hurricanes have been seen as positive triggers for international migration in CA (Spencer and Urquhart, 2018). The highlands of Peru see different patterns, including daily circular migration to combine the scarce income from agricultural production with urban income, rather than abandoning farm land (Milan and Ho, 2014; Zimmerer, 2014; Bergmann et al., 2021)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.8.4_p6,Peru;Guatemala,"The perception of gradual changes lowers the likelihood of internal migration, while sudden-onset events increase movement (Koubi et al., 2016). On the other hand, it has been seen that extreme events like floods or droughts can hinder population mobility, immobilising them in their localities (Thiede et al., 2016). These immobilised populations are supposed to face a double set of risks: they are unable to move away from environmental threats, and their lack of capital makes them especially vulnerable to environmental changes (Black et al., 2011). In CSA, migrating to the US is becoming dangerous and expensive because that country is restricting entry; these trends expose local populations to the risk of becoming immobile in the near future in a place where they are extremely vulnerable (Ruano and Milan, 2014; McLeman, 2019). A survey in Guatemala found no correlation between migration to the US and severe food insecurity in households, but the correlation became significant if the level of food insecurity was moderate, suggesting that families in extreme hardship did not have the resources to migrate (Aguilar et al., 2019). At the same time, some populations just have chosen not to move, as in Peru, where immobility among dissatisfied people is more likely to be caused by attachment to place than resource constraints (Adams, 2016; Correia and Ojima, 2017). Some populations have chosen to adapt relying on their IKLK (Boillat and Berkes, 2013)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.6.3_p1,Peru,"Lima-Callao Metropolitan Area, capital of Perú, is facing recurrent climate disasters providing lessons on water-related climate-proof governance reconfiguration. The first lesson is that when disasters affect poor and rich populations, dominant actors prioritise the integral city’s resilience and development and coordinate and collaborate within a concertation framework across institutional levels and geographical scales (Hommes and Boelens, 2017; Miranda Sara, 2021), even having different ideas, discourses, and power, recognising that no single actor has enough power. Second, water-related climate-change scenarios require comprehensive, transverse, multi-sectoral, multi-scalar, multiple types of actor knowledge (expert, tacit, codified and contextual embedded) (Pfeffer, 2018) and transparent information to manage the tensions and even conflicts when some knowledge is not shared or restricted, particularly when lower risk perception and higher risk tolerance are present. Finally, a concertative (processes involving a variety of actors, which has become mandatory in Peru) strategy to localise climate-changed-related action shows quicker, more effective and more transparent results (medium confidence, robust evidence, medium agreement ) (Miranda Sara and Baud, 2014; Pepermans and Maeseele, 2016; Siña et al., 2016; Miranda Sara et al., 2017)."

In early 2017, buildings along rivers, ravines and slopes suffered from floods, huaycos (mudslides), and the whole city experienced potable water cuts (Vázquez-Rowe et al., 2017) and vector-borne diseases affecting especially poorer but also richer inhabitants."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.6.3_p6,Peru,"The institutionalised culture of participation in Peru did lead to a broader concept of concertation, wherein practices of collaborative planning were developed to allow actors to build up socially supported agreements and decisions and take action without losing sight of their principles. These processes have been applied to reduce risks, to adapt and to anticipate uncertain and unknown futures; they also introduced climate-change concerns within a complex political and institutional environment surrounded by corruption scandals (Vergara, 2018; Durand, 2019) and growing political polarisation."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#FAQ 12.2_p11,Peru;Argentina,"Cities are interconnected systems operating beyond administrative boundaries. Improved collaboration and coordination are needed for integrated responses. Aside from good planning, cities need access to external adaptation funds. Climate-change adaptation requires long-term funding and investments, which are beyond cyclical political considerations. It is crucial to rethink how to ensure that international adaptation funds will reach cities and innovate. For example, member cities of Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy in the region, together with Cities for Life Forum in Peru, the Red Argentina de Municipios por el Cambio Climático (RAMCC), the Capital Cities of the Americas facing Climate Change (CC35) and others, are pursuing this goal and applying directly for international grants.

That territory has followed a pattern of urbanisation common in Latin America: its population has increased from around 500,000 people in the 1970s to nearly 3 million inhabitants by 2020, of which 80% live in urban areas (Municipio del Distrito Metropolitano de Quito, 2016). A massive inflow of people immigrated in the early 1970s due to various causes, including the search for the rents created as a result of the oil boom in the Ecuadorian Amazon, better working conditions, health, education and cultural services, in comparison with the rural areas or in mid-sized cities. As a result, the city underwent exponential growth, claiming valuable agricultural and forestry areas, as well as natural ecosystems, in the peripheries. Many of the new neighbourhoods were established through land invasions or informal markets, in many cases over steep slopes, in water sources and agricultural or conservation areas (high confidence) (Cuvi, 2015; Gómez Salazar and Cuvi, 2016). That exponential population growth, coupled with urban sprawl, poses many challenges to the city, including those related to climate change."

Rural poverty rates are higher—82% in Honduras and 77% in Guatemala in 2014—as is poverty among Indigenous Peoples, up to 79% in Guatemala. Rural poor are the most sensitive to climate extremes as their main economic activity is based on agriculture in vulnerable terrains (NU CEPAL, 2018). In 2014, all CA countries, except for El Salvador (excluding Belize), had higher GINI coefficients (more inequality) than the average for Latin America (0.473), which in itself is the most unequal region in the world (ECLAC, 2019b); in 2018 the situation remained similar, with El Salvador showing the lowest GINI coefficient (40) and the remaining countries showing values higher than the Latin American average (BCIE, 2020)."

By 2100, water availability per capita is projected to decrease 82% and 90% on average for the region under B2 (low emissions) and A2 (high emissions) scenarios respectively (Figure 12.3) (CEPAL, 2010)."

Bean production in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala, is projected to decrease, using the Decision Support for Agro-Technology Transfer (DSSAT) under the A2 scenario, by 19% for 2050, whereas maize production, depending on the water retention capacity of soils, will drop between 4% and 21% by 2050 (CEPAL et al., 2018). In Guatemala, the yield of rainfed maize is expected to decrease by 16% by 2050 under RCP8.5 using the Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison GGCMI; yields for rainfed sugarcane are expected to drop by 44% and irrigated sugarcane by 36% under the same modelling conditions (Castellanos et al., 2018).

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.1.3_p3,Guatemala;Honduras,"Since AR5, there has been an increase in the number of adaptation measures through natural resource and ecosystem service management. The main approaches are EbA and community-based adaptation (CbA) (high confidence) (NCs, NDCs and NAPs, https://unfccc.int). IKLK can be very detailed and usually relates to people’s priorities as identified by collective decision-making (Box 7.1) (Hurlbert et al., 2019, SRCCL Section 7.6.4; SRCCL Cross-Chapter Box 13 ILK; de Coninck et al., 2018, SR1.5 Section 4.3.5.5). In Manaus, central Amazon, fishermen perceive reductions in fish size, diversity and capture levels caused by droughts, while recognising that floods hinder access to fishing grounds (Keenan, 2015; Camacho Guerreiro et al., 2016). In the Amazon floodplains, small-scale fisher and farmer communities incorporate their knowledge on natural hydrologic and ecological processes into management systems that reduce climate-change risk and impacts (Oviedo et al., 2016). Smallholder grain farmers in Guatemala and Honduras implement EbA practices based on local knowledge (e.g., live fences, home gardens, shade trees in coffee plantations, dispersed trees in corn fields and other food insecurity risk reduction practices) (Harvey et al., 2017; Chain-Guadarrama et al., 2018). There is, therefore, great potential for terrestrial and freshwater ecosystem adaptation to climate change in CSA, provided the right incentives and sociocultural protective measures are in place (high confidence) (Section 12.5.10.4; Table SM12.7)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.8.1_p8,Guatemala,"Some conflicts in which the direct biophysical impacts of climate change play a major role can unleash social protests and strengthen social movements (Section 12.6.4). In Cartagena, since 2010, the increase in precipitation has increasingly impacted the barrioPolicarpa, promoprting residents to call for solutions to the problems caused by the coupled effect of flooding and industrial pollution. Also, in El Cambray II, in Guatemala City, in 2015 a nearby hill collapsed, causing the deaths of 280 people, 70 missing and the destruction of hundreds of homes. The affected community entered into a conflict with the municipality demanding resettlement and a reform of land-use planning (Stein Heinemann, 2018)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.6.4_p1,Guatemala,"Guatemala experiences high climate interannual variability, now increased from the effect of climate change (INSIVUMEH, 2018; Bardales et al., 2019). Impacts on human settlements, agriculture and ecosystems result from both excess and reduced precipitation (high confidence) (Section 12.3.1.4). Guerra (2016) argues that deficient IWRM in the country is the main reason for those impacts. A case in point is that of the Madre Vieja and Achiguate rivers, where an intense El Niño event triggered dryer conditions and, in turn, a crisis and conflict that reached national proportions. Progress in local water governance helped to solve that crisis and helped tackle challenges posed by reduced precipitation and flood risk in southern Guatemala."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.6.4_p2,Guatemala,"The ENSO event that started in November 2014 and ended in July 2016 (CIIFEN, 2016) was the most intense since records commenced in 1950 (NOAA, 2019). Its effects were felt in different parts of the world, and Guatemala and the rest of CA experienced intense water scarcity due to a significant reduction in rainfall (high confidence) (IICA, 2015; Scientific American, 2015). River flow in the dry months is related to precipitation levels in the previous rainy season, so ENSO has an effect on river flow rates. Two of the main rivers in the Pacific coast of Guatemala, Madre Vieja and Achiguate, dried out completely at the beginning of 2016, triggering a nearly violent local conflict that caught the attention of national leaders (Guerra, 2016; Gobernación de Escuintla et al., 2017). In addition to the severe drought, the rivers dried because of overextraction by multiple users (60 in the case of Madre Vieja). This had happened before to a lesser extent in the last 20 years during the critical months of the dry season. A lack of regulation, coordination mechanisms, information and other elements of water governance was the root cause of the problem, exacerbated by the drier conditions during the intense El Niño event, resulting in the intensification of an existing conflict (high confidence) (Guerra, 2016)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.6.4_p3,Guatemala,"Roundtables were set up to foster dialogue between numerous stakeholders, including communities, agri-export companies, governmental organisations and municipalities, all led by the local governor (Gobernación de Escuintla et al., 2017). Agreements included keeping a minimum river flow all the way to the sea, setting up a monitoring and verification system for levels of river flow and restoring riparian forests. A system was set up to monitor river flow at different points along the rivers on a daily basis in the dry season using a simple WhatsApp-based system to communicate the warnings and monitor compliance. Four years on, the rivers had not dried out and conflict was kept to a minimum. Rural communities can use rivers for recreational purposes and for fishing all year round, while plantations (large and small) can use water for irrigation (rationally) and keep producing. Similar schemes and interactions started happening in other rivers in the Pacific coast of Guatemala, with positive results, in particular, rivers kept flowing all through the dry season, as can be seen in the report of river flows for the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 (ICC, 2019b)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.6.4_p4,Guatemala,"A key actor in the improvement of water governance has been the private Institute for Climate Change Research (ICC). This is a unique initiative that was created in 2010 and is funded primarily by the private sector of Guatemala to help the country advance in climate-change mitigation and adaptation (Guerra, 2014). The institute works alongside local governments, communities and private companies in several areas besides integrated water management. Its role is merely technical-scientific: it oversees the water monitoring system, generating data on weather and hydrology and providing support to other stakeholders."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.6.4_p5,Guatemala,"Local governance was also essential for the implementation of flood risk management actions (high confidence). Guerra et al. (2017) explained how impacts were significantly reduced in the Coyolate River watershed, as well as on the Pacific coast of Guatemala, thanks to flood protection that was designed and implemented in a technical and integrated manner. This was a result of the strong and active participation of local communities, companies and the local municipality, which demanded that the central government invest effectively. The stakeholders provided some resources (financial and in-kind) and inspected the works. Some flat areas of the lower Coyolate watershed used to flood annually, causing economic damage in communities. The areas covered by flood risk measures have not flooded and so have avoided losses and created conditions that attract investment and create jobs, improving living conditions for the locals. Other processes of participation and interaction between the authorities, the private sector and communities have taken place in other watersheds for planning, action and investment in connection with flood risk management. The ICC has played a role by studying flood-prone areas, building capacities in communities, fostering public–private coordination mechanisms and providing much needed technical assistance to local governments (ICC, 2019a)."

Data deficiencies must be overcome as renewed research on climate change updates models, scenarios and projected impacts across sectors and levels (i.e., household to country). In NWS, there is a lack of studies on the relationships with increased fire events, and the impacts on the infrastructure of all kinds, on certain lowland, marine and coastal ecosystems and on ecosystem functioning and the provision of environmental services. Experimental studies are rare and most necessary to identify critical ecological thresholds to support decision-making processes, linking glacier retreat to its consequences on biodiversity and ecosystems, combined with different land use trajectories. Complex interactions with processes such as peace agreements in Colombia are yet to be investigated (Salazar et al., 2018). In NSA, there remains a limited amount of peer-reviewed literature addressing the implications of climate change on Indigenous cultures and their livelihoods.

In Bolivia, CMIP3/5 models projected an increase in temperature (2.5°C–5.9°C), with seasonal and regional differences. In the lowlands, both ensembles agreed on less rainfall (–19%) during drier months (June–August and September–November), with significant changes in interannual rainfall variability, but disagreed on changes during wetter months (January–March) (Seiler et al., 2013). As a consequence of higher temperatures and reduced rainfall, an increased water deficit would be expected in the Brazilian Pantanal (Marengo et al., 2016; Bergier et al., 2018; Llopart et al., 2020) with high confidence. The largest increases in warmer days and nights, and aridity, drought and significant increases in fire occurrence are calculated over the Amazon area (Huang et al., 2016). Over the entire region, by mid-century (RCP4.5) there is medium confidence of increases in river and pluvial floods, aridity and mean wind speed, and extreme heat, fire weather and drought are projected to increase with high confidence (WGI AR6 Table 12.6; Ranasinghe et al., 2021)."

Indigenous and social movements have joined with climate justice activists, calling for action to address climate change (Hicks and Fabricant, 2016; Ruiz-Mallén et al., 2017; Charles, 2021). The Bolivian Platform against Climate Change, a coalition of civil society and social movement organisations working to address the effects of global warming in Bolivia and to influence the broader global community, reflects an innovative dimension that, though at times conflictual, has shown how increasing climate variability hinders the right of Indigenous Peoples to the conservation of their culture and practices and illustrates how grassroots movements are increasingly taking over climate-change policy in the region (Hicks and Fabricant, 2016).

In Bolivia, glacial retreat has not triggered new migration flows and had a limited impact on the existing migratory patterns (Kaenzig, 2015). In SA, climatic variability increases the likelihood of interprovince migration, rather than trapping populations. In a study of interprovincial migration motivated by temperature, an exception arose in Bolivia, and even if that could suggest an immobilised population (Thiede et al., 2016), it is not clear whether they want to stay and adapt.

Temperature and the amount and seasonal distribution of precipitation were important controls of vegetation structure in Patagonian rangelands (Gaitán et al., 2014). They found that over two-thirds of the total effect of precipitation on above-ground net primary production (ANPP) was direct, and the other third was indirect (via the effects of precipitation on vegetation structure). Thus, if evapotranspiration and drought stress increase as temperature increases and rainfall decreases in water-limited ecosystems, a greater exposure of ranchers to a reduction in stocking rate and, therefore, family income would be expected (medium confidence).

The management of Peruvian artisanal (medium and small-scale) fisheries is minimal and is governed by a lack of regulations, control and management actions (Bertrand et al., 2018). In Argentina, recreational marine fisheries have been largely unregulated, and there exists a lack of monitoring programmes, which has contributed to the overexploitation of some key coastal stocks (Venerus and Cedrola, 2017). Moreover, womenfisher in CSA are excluded of the decision-making processes (FAO, 2016b; Bruguere and Williams, 2017).

In Panama, rainfall was associated with an increased number of malaria cases among the Gunas, an Indigenous People with high vulnerability living in poverty conditions on small islands affected by SLR (Hurtado et al., 2018).

Table 12.1 shows the changes observed in reproduction potential for dengue in the different sub-regions due to changes in rainfall and temperature. Forest fires pose a major threat to public health in the region because they relate to an increase in hospital admissions due to respiratory problems, mainly among children and the elderly (Figure 12.5). The amount of air pollutants detected is sometimes higher than that observed in large urban areas, especially during dry seasons when biomass burning increases (Aragão et al., 2016; de Oliveira Alves et al., 2017; Paralovo et al., 2019)."
