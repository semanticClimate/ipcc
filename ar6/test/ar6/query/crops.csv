Losses of biomass as high as 40% are projected in CA with a warming of 3°C–4°C, and the Amazon may experience a significant dieback at similar warming levels (SR15 Chapter 3, Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018). Advances in second-generation bioethanol from sugarcane and other feedstock will be important for mitigation. However, agricultural expansion results in large conversions in tropical dry woodlands and savannahs in SA (Brazilian Cerrado, Caatinga and Chaco) (high confidence) (SRCCL Chapter 1, Arneth et al., 2019). The expansion of soybean plantations in the Amazonian state of Mato Grosso in Brazil reached 16.8% yr −1 from 2000 to 2005; and oil palm, a significant biofuel crop, is also linked to recent deforestation in tropical CA (Costa Rica and Honduras) and SA (Colombia and Ecuador), although lower in magnitude compared to deforestation from soybean and cattle ranching (WGII AR5 Chapter 27, Magrin et al., 2014)."

Bean production in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala, is projected to decrease, using the Decision Support for Agro-Technology Transfer (DSSAT) under the A2 scenario, by 19% for 2050, whereas maize production, depending on the water retention capacity of soils, will drop between 4% and 21% by 2050 (CEPAL et al., 2018). In Guatemala, the yield of rainfed maize is expected to decrease by 16% by 2050 under RCP8.5 using the Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison GGCMI; yields for rainfed sugarcane are expected to drop by 44% and irrigated sugarcane by 36% under the same modelling conditions (Castellanos et al., 2018).

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.3.3.4_p1,Sugarcane,"Suriname has experienced coastal erosion and flooding, which causes damage to infrastructure, agriculture and ecosystems, while Georgetown has suffered a significant number of floods (CAF, 2014). In Guyana, coastal flooding has negatively impacted agricultural activity (Tomby and Zhang, 2018) (Figure 12.9). Sugarcane production has been one of the most impacted cash crops. The impact on sugar production has affected Guyana’s sugar industry (Tomby and Zhang, 2019). Among the main impacts observed in the sugar industry are an increase in production costs, greater use of pesticides and fertilizers and a reduction in worker income (Tomby and Zhang, 2018)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.3.4.2_p1,Sugarcane,"A large expansion in cropland area (soybean, corn and sugarcane) was observed in the past two decades in SAM, in response to increased local and global demand for biofuels and agricultural commodities (high confidence) (Lapola et al., 2014; Cohn et al., 2016). Feedbacks to the climate system resulting from such land use changes are intricate. The clear-cutting of Amazon forest and Cerrado savannah in the region led to a local warming due to an increase in the energy balance and evapotranspiration (Malhado et al., 2010); in contrast, the replacement of pasture by agriculture have led to a local cooling effect, due to changes in the surface albedo (medium confidence: medium evidence, medium agreement ). Deforestation of the Amazon for pastures and soybean have decreased evapotranspiration during drought months and caused a localised lengthening of the dry season in northwestern SAM by 6.5 (± 2.5) d since 1979 (medium confidence: medium evidence, medium agreement ) (Fu et al., 2013)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.4_p1,Sugarcane;Coffee;Bananas,"The CSA region globally has the greatest agricultural land and water availability per capita. With 15% of the world’s land area, it receives 29% of global precipitation and has 33% of globally available renewable resources (Flachsbarth et al., 2015). Agricultural commodities (coffee, bananas, sugar, soybean, corn, sugarcane, beef livestock) are some of the highest users of ecosystem resources such as land, water, nutrients and technology. These exports have gained importance in the past two decades as international trade and globalisation of markets have shaped the global agri-food system. However continuous overuse of the environment might account for resource depletion (deforestation, land degradation, nutrient depletion, pollution), affecting the natural capital base. The effects of climate change on humans, via ecological systems, exacerbate the impact related to the depletion of ecosystem services (Scholes, 2016; IPBES, 2018b; Castaneda Sanchez et al., 2019; Clerici et al., 2019; Tellman et al., 2020; Pacheco et al., 2021)."

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.3.5_p4,Rice,"Land ecosystems contribute substantially to global emissions of nitrous oxide and methane . As with CO2, these emissions respond both directly and indirectly to atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate change, and this gives rise to potential additional bio-geochemical feedbacks in the climate system. A large part of these emissions stem from land and water management, such as fertilizer application, rice production, aquaculture or animal husbandry (Jia et al., 2019). However, nearly 60% of total nitrous oxide emissions (in 2007–2016) has been estimated to stem from natural ecosystems, especially in the Tropics (Tian et al., 2019; Canadell et al., 2021), while freshwater wetlands and peatlands are estimated to contribute between 83% (top-down estimates) and 40% (bottom-up estimates) of total natural CH4 (and 31 and 20% of total methane emissions, respectively) for the period 2008–2017 (Canadell et al., 2021). Median CH4 emissions from northern-latitude wetlands in 2100 were estimated to be 12.1 and 13.5 PgC in emission scenarios leading to 1.5°C and 2°C warming, respectively (Comyn-Platt et al., 2018). Likewise, global warming has been attributed to soil N2O emission increases since the pre-industrial period of 0.8 (0.3–1.3) TgN yr -1 (Tian et al., 2020). Overall, climate feedbacks from future altered land ecosystem emissions of CH4 or N2O are uncertain, but are expected to be small (Canadell et al., 2021)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.2_p3,Rice;Maize;Wheat;Coffee,"Climate projections indicate increases in temperature for the entire region by 2100 for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, but rainfall changes will vary geographically, with a notable reduction of −22% in northeastern Brazil and an increase of +25% in SES. Significant dependency on rainfed agriculture (>30% in Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua) indicates high sensitivity to climatic variability and change and represents a challenge for food security (high confidence) (SRCCL Chapter 5, Mbow et al., 2019). Undernutrition has worsened since 2014 in CSA (SRCCL Chapter 5, Mbow et al., 2019). Evidence of climate-change impacts on food security is emerging from IKLK studies in SA. Municipalities in CA with a high proportion of subsistence crops tend to have fewer resources for adaptation and more vulnerable to climate change (SRCCL Chapter 5, Mbow et al., 2019). Rising temperature and decreased rainfall could reduce agricultural productivity by 2030, threatening the food security of the poorest populations (WGII AR5 Chapter 27, Magrin et al., 2014). Though reduced suitability and yield for beans, coffee, maize, plantain and rice are expected in CA (SRCCL Chapter 5, Mbow et al., 2019), limiting the warming to 1.5°C, compared with 2°C, are projected to result in smaller net reductions in yields of maize, rice, wheat and other cereal crops for CSA (high confidence) (SR15 Chapter 3, Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018). The heat stress is expected to reduce the suitability of Arabica coffee in Mesoamerica, but it can improve in high-latitude areas in SA (SRCCL Chapter 4, Olsson et al., 2019). There is limited evidence that these declines in crop yields may result in significant population displacement from the tropics to the sub-tropics (SR15 Chapter 3, Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018)."

Crop losses largely result from highly variable rainfall and seasonal droughts, which have increased significantly in recent decades (Table 12.3) (CEPAL and CAC-SICA, 2020), particularly the observed changes in the MSD that reduces rainfall at the onset of the rainy season (May–June) (Anderson et al., 2019). Small and subsistence farmers experience the highest impact because they practice rainfed agriculture (Imbach et al., 2017), along with poor neighbourhoods, which face socioeconomic and physical barriers for adapting to climate change (Kongsager, 2017). In 2015, precipitation diminished between 50% and 70% of its historic average, causing a loss of up to 80% of beans and 60% of maize, leaving 2.5 million people food insecure, 1.6 million of whom were in the Dry Corridor of CA (ECLAC et al., 2015; FAO, 2016a). In 2019, the region entered its fifth consecutive drought year, with 1.4 million people in need of food aid. Seasonal-scale droughts are projected to lengthen by 12–30%, intensify by 17–42% and increase in frequency by 21–42% in RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios by the end of the century (Depsky and Pons, 2021)."

The suitable area for maize will experience a 35% reduction of cultivated area expected by 2100 under the A2 scenario. The area suitable for beans is expected to shrink by 2050. Projections show that suitable areas with excellent capacity under current conditions will decrease by 14%, mainly in Panama (41%) Costa Rica (21%) and El Salvador (20%). The Species Distribution Model, using the IPSL GCM, projects that the suitable zones for cacao and coffee will shrink between 25% and 75% under RCP6.0 (Fernandez-Manjarrés, 2018; Fernández Kolb et al., 2019). Warmer and dryer lower areas will become unsuitable for coffee and will drive its production to higher land (Läderach et al., 2013; Bunn et al., 2015). Under the A2 climate-change scenario, areas with excellent capacity for Arabica coffee will decrease by 12% in CA; coffee yield will decrease in suitable zones whereby the extent of high yield (>0.8 T ha −1) zones is projected to shrink from 34% to 12%, whereas low-yield (<0.3 T ha −1) zones will expand from 14% to 36% by 2100 under the A2 scenario (CEPAL and CAC/SICA, 2014)."

Shifts in tree species distribution may result in decreased above-ground carbon stocks and productivity in tropical mountain forests (high confidence) (Feeley et al., 2011; Duque et al., 2015; Fadrique et al., 2018; Duque et al., 2021), a biomass loss that will only be partially offset through increased recruitment and growth of lowland species migrating upslope. Water scarcity can enhance tree mortality and decrease above-ground carbon stocks (Álvarez-Dávila et al., 2017; McDowell et al., 2020). The agricultural frontier of crops, such as potatoes or maize, is moving upwards (high confidence), following the freezing level height upward displacement (Morueta-Holme et al., 2015; Skarbø and VanderMolen, 2016; Schauwecker et al., 2017; Vuille et al., 2018). Modelling exercises agree with the observed impacts in species, ecosystem processes, crop impacts and related pests and diseases (high confidence) (Cernusak et al., 2013; Tovar et al., 2013; Ramirez-Villegas et al., 2014; Ovalle-Rivera et al., 2015; van der Sleen et al., 2015; Lowe et al., 2017). Agricultural options are changing as a result of intra-seasonal temperature variation (Ponce, 2020). Changes in the timing and amount of precipitation are also impacting agriculture (Table 12.4) (Heikkinen, 2017; Altea, 2020)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.4.3_p2,Maize;Cattle;Coffee,"The main adaptation options for climate change in the region include preventive measures against soil erosion; climate-smart agriculture, which provides a framework for synergies between adaptation, mitigation and improved food security; climate information systems; land use planning; shifting plantations at high altitudes to avoid temperature increases and plagues; and improved varieties of pastures and cattle (Lee et al., 2014; Jat et al., 2016; Crumpler et al., 2020; Moreno et al., 2020a; Aragón et al., 2021). Agricultural technologies are not necessarily changing, but the economic activity is shifting to accommodate increasing climate variation and adapt to changes in water availability and ideal growing conditions (high confidence), as is observed in Argentina, Colombia and Brazil (McMartin et al., 2018; Rolla et al., 2018; Sloat et al., 2020; Gori Maia et al., 2021). Coffee plantations are moving further up mountain regions, with the land at lower elevations converted for other uses. In Brazil, crop modelling suggests the need for the development of new cultivars, with a longer crop cycle and with higher tolerance to high temperatures, a necessary technological advance for maize, an essential staple crop, to be produced in the future. Additionally, irrigation becomes essential for sustaining productivity in adverse climate-change scenarios in several regions of CSA (McMartin et al., 2018; Lyons, 2019; Reay, 2019)."

Deforestation of mangrove forests caused 10–30% of deforestation emissions in Indonesia from 1980 to 2005 (Donato et al., 2011; Murdiyarso et al., 2015), even though mangroves comprised only 3% of Indonesia primary forest area in 2000 (Margono et al., 2014; Murdiyarso et al., 2015)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#FAQ 2.3_p6,Oil palm,"In other regions, wildfires are also burning wider areas and occurring more often. This is consistent with climate change, but analyses have not yet shown if climate change is more important than other factors. In the Amazon, deforestation by companies, farmers and herders who cut down and intentionally burn rainforests to expand agricultural fields and pastures causes wildfires even in relatively moister years. Drought exacerbates these fires. In Australia, much of the southeastern part of the continent has experienced extreme wildfire years, but analyses suggest that El Niño, a heat phenomenon that cycles up and down periodically, is more important than long-term climate change. In Indonesia, intentional burning of rainforests for oil palm plantations and El Niño seem to be more important than long-term climate change. In Mediterranean Europe, fire suppression seems to have prevented any increasing trend in burned area but the suppression and abandonment of agricultural lands have allowed fuel to build up in some areas and contribute to major fires in years of extreme heat. In Canada and Siberia, wildfires are now burning more often in permafrost areas where fire was rare, but analyses are lacking regarding the relative influence of climate change. For the world as a whole, satellite data indicate that the vast amount of land converted from forest to farmland in the period 1998–2015 actually decreased the total burned area. Nevertheless, the evidence from the forests of western North America shows that human-caused climate change has, at least on one continent, clearly driven increases in wildfire."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.2.6_p6,Oil palm;Rubber,"The impact of unsustainable land use on tropical forests continues in all regions (see Cross-Chapter Paper 7). Projected climate changes will not only impact biodiversity but also the livelihoods of affected people (robust evidence, high agreement ). Increased drought drives crop failures that cause local communities to expand their agricultural area by further clearing native forests (Desbureaux and Damania, 2018). Climate change is projected to enlarge the area of suitability for booming tree crops such as oil palm, acacia, Eucalyptus and rubber (Koninck et al., 2011; Cramb et al., 2015; Nath, 2016; Hurni et al., 2017; Li et al., 2017; Varkkey et al., 2018). An increase of 8% in the area of rubber plantations in Yunnan Province, China, between 2002–2010 to higher altitudes due to decreased environmental limits, has potentially increased pressure on the remaining biodiversity both within and outside of protected areas (Zomer et al., 2014a). As a consequence, the suitable area for mammals is projected to be reduced by 47.7% (RCP2.6) and 67.7% (RCP8.5) by 2070, with large variability depending on the different species (Cross-Chapter Paper 7) (Brodie, 2016). To minimize these potential threats, the Yunnan provincial government has identified suitable areas for the establishment of national parks, including the Asian Elephant National Park since 2006. And the government of China developed a national park system in 2013 across the country."

There is a lack of information regarding the combined effects of climate change and overgrazing and the consequences for pastoral livelihoods that depend on rangelands. Temperature and the amount and seasonal distribution of precipitation were important controls of vegetation structure in Patagonian rangelands (Gaitán et al., 2014). They found that over two-thirds of the total effect of precipitation on above-ground net primary production (ANPP) was direct, and the other third was indirect (via the effects of precipitation on vegetation structure). Thus, if evapotranspiration and drought stress increase as temperature increases and rainfall decreases in water-limited ecosystems, a greater exposure of ranchers to a reduction in stocking rate and, therefore, family income would be expected (medium confidence).

In Honduras, rainfall and relative humidity were positively correlated with the occurrence of haemorrhagic dengue cases (Zambrano et al., 2012). In Costa Rica, temperature and rainfall were correlated to cattle rabies outbreaks and mortality during 1985–2016 (Hutter et al., 2018); incidence of leishmaniasis showed cycles of 3 years related to temperature changes (Chaves and Pascual, 2006); and snakebites were more likely to occur at high temperatures and were significantly reduced after the rainy season for the period 2005–2013 (Chaves et al., 2015). In Panama, rainfall was associated with an increased number of malaria cases among the Gunas, an Indigenous People with high vulnerability living in poverty conditions on small islands affected by SLR (Hurtado et al., 2018). These correlations point to a possible change in disease incidence with climate change; evidence of that change is yet to be reported in the literature because longitudinal studies are lacking in the region."

In some cases farmers respond to extreme temperatures by increasing use of land and crop intensity (Aragón et al., 2021). Climate change has prompted and will continue to prompt internal and international migrations (Løken, 2019; Bergmann et al., 2021). A change in fire regimes and fire risk is expected in highland ecosystems, although it is difficult to determine the influence of human activities and climate change influence on fire patterns (Oliveras et al., 2014, 2018; Armenteras et al., 2020)."

Costa Rica offers an example on how reforestation can help achieve Paris Agreement objectives. Reforestation through natural regeneration on abandoned pastures boosted forest cover from 48% in 2005 to 53.4% in 2010 (Reid et al., 2019; Cárdenas et al., 2021). Some key success factors included a strong institutional context, fiscal and financial incentives for reforestation, conservation measures such as payment for environmental services, cattle ranch subsidy reform and a historically strong enforcement and focus on land titles that favoured the restoration of lands. Uruguay offers another example, with the farm sector contribution of 32.8% of all exports and 73.8% of the country’s emissions, so decarbonisation is not just an environmental issue but an economic competitiveness one as well. In the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) submitted to the UNFCCC in 2015, Uruguay set a specific target for the agriculture sector to reduce enteric methane emissions intensity per kilogram of beef (live weight) by 33% to 46% in 2030 by improving efficiency of beef production by controlling the grazing intensity to increase animal intake, reproductive efficiency and daily weight gain (Picasso et al., 2014)."

When it gets hot, the snails can produce 2–3 times as many infective larvae; however, if it becomes too hot, many pathogens and their vectors cannot survive or reproduce."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.5.5 _p4,Eggs,"Historically, hunting and the collection of eggs and guano were the main threats, but three aspects of climate change now predominate. Firstly, an eastward shift of several hundred kilometres in the distributions of their main prey species, anchovies and sardines, has reduced food availability (Roy et al., 2007; Crawford et al., 2011). While adult penguins typically forage up to 400 km from their colonies, they are restricted to a ~20-km radius from their colonies during breeding months (Ludynia et al., 2012; Pichegru et al., 2012). The resulting food shortage at this critical time is compounded by competition with commercial fisheries and environmental fluctuations (Crawford et al., 2011; Pichegru et al., 2012; Sherley et al., 2018). This has impacted adults’ survival and their ability to raise high-quality offspring (Crawford et al., 2006; Crawford et al., 2011; Sherley et al., 2013; Sherley et al., 2014)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.5.5 _p5,Eggs,"The increasing frequency and intensity of heat waves recorded in recent decades presents a second threat (van Wilgen and Wannenburgh, 2016; Van Wilgen et al., 2016; Mbokodo et al., 2020). Nests were historically built in insulated guano burrows, but are now frequently sited on open ground (Kemper et al., 2007; Pichegru et al., 2012; Sherley et al., 2012). High temperatures frequently expose the birds to severe heat stress, causing adults to abandon their nests and resulting in the mortality of eggs and chicks (Frost et al., 1976; Shannon and Crawford, 1999; Pichegru et al., 2012). Intensifying storm surges and greater wave heights can cause nest flooding (Randall et al., 1986; de Villiers, 2002)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.5.5 _p8,Eggs,"Hand-rearing and releasing African penguin chicks, including from eggs, has long proven valuable because moulting parents, being shore-bound, are unable to feed late-hatching chicks. Since 2006, over 7,000 orphaned chicks have been released into the wild as part of the Chick Bolstering Project, with a success rate of 77% (Schwitzer et al., 2013; Sherley et al., 2014; Klusener et al., 2018; SANCCOB, 2018). A new project at Boulders Beach aims to use real-time weather station data, within-nest temperatures and known thresholds of penguin heat stress as triggers for implementing a Heat Wave Response Plan. Drawing on well-established chick-rearing facilities and a large body of expertise, this includes removing heat-stressed eggs and birds, hand-rearing and/or rehabilitation and release. It is hoped that such birds can be released at the proposed new colony site."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.3.6.1_p3,Rubber,"Net effects of deforestation and afforestation on runoff and water supply depend on local factors, leading to conflicting evidence of effects of land cover change (Ellison et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2021b), but combinations of climate change and deforestation are projected to reduce water flows (Olivares et al., 2019). In southern Thailand, the combination of the conversion of forest to rubber plantations and a one-third increase in rainfall could increase erosion and sediment load by 15% (Trisurat et al., 2016). In the watershed that supplies São Paulo, Brazil, afforestation could increase water quantity and quality (Ferreira et al., 2019). In most regions with dry or Mediterranean subtropical climates, projected climate change can reduce surface water and groundwater resources (Doell et al., 2015). In northeast Spain, reduced precipitation and vegetation cover under the high-emissions scenario of a 3.5°C temperature increase could reduce drinking water supplies by half by 2100 (Bangash et al., 2013)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.5.5 _p6,Rubber,"The African penguin’s survival in the wild is dependent on the success of adaptation action. Increasing access to food resources is a management priority (Birdlife International, 2018). One approach is to reduce fishing pressure immediately around breeding colonies. An experiment excluding fishing around colonies since 2008 has demonstrated positive effects (Pichegru et al., 2010; Pichegru et al., 2012; Sherley et al., 2015; Sherley et al., 2018; Campbell et al., 2019b). A second approach is to establish breeding colonies closer to their prey. An ongoing translocation initiative aims to entice birds eastwards, to recolonise an extinct breeding colony and potentially establish a new one (Schwitzer et al., 2013; Sherley et al., 2014; Birdlife International, 2018). Penguin ‘look-alikes’ or decoys, constructed from rubber and concrete, have been placed at the site of the extinct colony, and, along with call play-backs, these give the illusion of an established penguin colony (Morris and Hagen, 2018). This approach has not yet proven successful."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.3.2.4_p4,Coffee,"Irrigation, potable water, health and education infrastructures, as well as roads, bridges, cities and residential constructions, are frequently damaged or destroyed by extreme precipitation events, which also impact sediment transport, river erosion and annual discharge (very high confidence) (Martínez et al., 2017; Morera et al., 2017; Isla, 2018; Rosales-Rueda, 2018; Salazar et al., 2018; Puente-Sotomayor et al., 2021). The increasing variability of precipitation has compromised rainfed agriculture and power generation, particularly in the dry season (high confidence) (Bradley et al., 2006; Bury et al., 2013; Buytaert et al., 2017; Carey et al., 2017; Vuille et al., 2018; Orlove et al., 2019). For the Amazon–Andes transition zone, the impacts of hydrological variability and transport of sediments have been noticed in riparian agriculture and biodiversity (high confidence) (Maeda et al., 2015; Espinoza et al., 2016; Vauchel et al., 2017; Ronchail et al., 2018; Ayes Rivera et al., 2019; Armijos et al., 2020; Figueroa et al., 2020; Pabón-Caicedo et al., 2020). Changes in seasonality and rain patterns are affecting coffee producers (Lambert and Eise, 2020)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.3.6.4_p1,Coffee,"Despite the observed increase in rainfall in the region, between 2014 and 2016 Brazil endured a water crisis that affected the population and economy of major capital cities in the SES region (Blunden and Arndt, 2014; Nobre et al., 2016a). Extremely long dry spells have become more frequent in southeastern Brazil, affecting 40 million people and the economies in cities such as Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Belo Horizonte, which are the industrial centres of the country (medium confidence: medium evidence, medium agreement ) (PBMC, 2014; Nobre et al., 2016a; Cunningham et al., 2017; Marengo et al., 2017, 2020b; Lima and Magaña Rueda, 2018). They have also impacted agriculture, affecting food supply and rural livelihoods, especially in Minas Gerais (Nehren et al., 2019). Agricultural prices increased by 30% in some cases, and harvest yields of sugar cane, coffee and fruits suffered a reduction of 15–40% in the region. The number of fires increased by 150%, and energy prices increased by 20–25%, as most electricity comes from hydroelectric power (Nobre et al., 2016a). In Argentina, projected changes in the hydrology of Andean rivers associated with glacier retreat are predicted to have negative impacts on the region’s fruit production (low evidence, medium agreemen t) (Barros et al., 2015)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.1.3_p3,Coffee,"Since AR5, there has been an increase in the number of adaptation measures through natural resource and ecosystem service management. The main approaches are EbA and community-based adaptation (CbA) (high confidence) (NCs, NDCs and NAPs, https://unfccc.int). IKLK can be very detailed and usually relates to people’s priorities as identified by collective decision-making (Box 7.1) (Hurlbert et al., 2019, SRCCL Section 7.6.4; SRCCL Cross-Chapter Box 13 ILK; de Coninck et al., 2018, SR1.5 Section 4.3.5.5). In Manaus, central Amazon, fishermen perceive reductions in fish size, diversity and capture levels caused by droughts, while recognising that floods hinder access to fishing grounds (Keenan, 2015; Camacho Guerreiro et al., 2016). In the Amazon floodplains, small-scale fisher and farmer communities incorporate their knowledge on natural hydrologic and ecological processes into management systems that reduce climate-change risk and impacts (Oviedo et al., 2016). Smallholder grain farmers in Guatemala and Honduras implement EbA practices based on local knowledge (e.g., live fences, home gardens, shade trees in coffee plantations, dispersed trees in corn fields and other food insecurity risk reduction practices) (Harvey et al., 2017; Chain-Guadarrama et al., 2018). There is, therefore, great potential for terrestrial and freshwater ecosystem adaptation to climate change in CSA, provided the right incentives and sociocultural protective measures are in place (high confidence) (Section 12.5.10.4; Table SM12.7)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.4.3_p3,Coffee;Cotton,"Livestock production is for small farmers one of the main sources of protein and contributes to food security (Rodríguez et al., 2016). The importance of this sub-sector in CSA will continue to increase as the demand for meat products does as well in the coming years, driven by growing incomes in the region (OECD and FAO, 2019). However, the increase in animal production has been associated with land degradation, triggered by the conversion of native vegetation to pastureland and aggravated by overgrazing and abandoning of the degraded pastures (Baumann et al., 2017; ECLAC, 2018; Müller-Hansen et al., 2019). Sá et al. (2017) simulated the adoption of agricultural systems based on LCA strategies towards 2050. According to the simulation, the adoption of LCA strategies in the SA region can alter the growing trend of land use and land use change emissions, and at the same time, it can increase meat production by 55 Mt for the entire period (2016–2050). The restoration of degraded pasture and livestock intensification account for 71.2% and integrated crop–livestock–forestry system contributes 28.8% of total meat production for the entire period. These results indicate that combined actions in agricultural management systems in SA can result in synergistic responses that can be used to make agriculture and livestock production an important part of the solution of global climate change and advance food security (medium confidence: insufficient evidence and high agreement ) (Zu Ermgassen et al., 2018; Pompeu et al., 2021). Crop–livestock–forestry systems are also important for climate-change adaptation as they provide multiple benefits, including the coproduction of food, animal feed, organic fertilizers and soil organic carbon sequestration (Sharma et al., 2016; Rodríguez et al., 2021), achieving mitigation and adaptation goals (high confidence) (Picasso et al., 2014; Modernel et al., 2016, 2019; Rolla et al., 2019; Locatelli et al., 2020). A recent analysis of agroforestry in Brazil showed positive and relevant impacts on the heads/pasture area rate in livestock production and that the system may have also stimulated a shift towards other production activities with higher gross added value (Gori Maia et al., 2021). Agroforestry has also proven to have protective benefits to obtain more stable, less fluctuating yields due to climate-related damage in coffee production (high confidence) (Bacon et al., 2017; Durand-Bessart et al., 2020; Ovalle-Rivera et al., 2020). In the same way, the production of plant-based fibre can be less vulnerable to economic and climatic variability through farming system diversification. Textile fibre crops for the case of cotton include crop rotation, agroecological intercropping and agroforestry (Oliveira Duarte et al., 2019)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#FAQ 12.4_p7,Coffee,"Agroforestry systems are present in the tropical region of CSA. Trees are present in a large part of the agricultural landscape of this region, either dispersed or in lines, supporting the production of coffee, cocoa, fruits, pastures and livestock in various agroforestry configurations. In CA, shade-grown coffee reduces weed control and improves the quality and taste of the product. Agroforestry uses nitrogen-fixing trees (Leguminosae), such as Leucaena in Colombia and Inga in Brazil, to restore soil nitrogen fertility. Tropical forest soils are generally nutrient-poor and unsuited to long-term agricultural use. Land converted to agriculture by cutting and burning natural vegetation tends to remain productive for only a few years. Agroforestry and so-called silvopastoral systems, which incorporate trees into crop and livestock systems, have been shown to have a dramatic impact on the maintenance and restoration of long-term productivity in agricultural landscapes, including degraded and abandoned land. Agroforestry systems can provide major benefits through enhanced food security, stronger local economies and increased ecosystem services such as carbon storage, regulation of climate and water cycles, control of pests and diseases and maintenance of soil fertility. Because of these multiple goods and services, agroforestry practices are considered one of the key strategies for the development of climate-smart agriculture."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.1.1_p1,Soybeans,"The conversion of natural ecosystems to agriculture, pasture and other land uses in CSA has been identified as a major challenge to climate-change adaptation in the region (high confidence) (Scarano et al., 2018; IPCC, 2019a). In the last three decades, SA has been a significant contributor to the growth of agricultural production worldwide (OECD/Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2015), driven partly by increased international demand for commodities, especially soybeans and meat (IPCC, 2019a). Between 2001 and 2015 about 65% of all forest disturbance in the region was associated with commodity-driven deforestation (Curtis et al., 2018). High rates of native vegetation conversion in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay and Peru threaten important ecosystems (Amazon, Cerrado, Chacos and Llanos savannahs, Atlantic rainforest, Caatinga and Yungas) (Graesser et al., 2015; FAO, 2016c). Almost two-thirds of soy consumed in EU+ comes from Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay (IDH, 2020), increasing conversion risk in the Amazon, Cerrado and Gran Chaco. Despite growing commodity production traceability, in 2018 only 19% of the soybean meal consumed in EU+ was certified deforestation-free and 38% compliant with the FEFAC Soy Sourcing Guidelines (IDH, 2020), which poses a serious challenge at the international level (Negra et al., 2014; Curtis et al., 2018; Lambin et al., 2018; IDH, 2020)."
