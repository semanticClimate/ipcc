cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#FAQ 2.2_p5,malaria;dengue fever,"Climate change can also have complicated, compounding and contradictory effects on pathogens and vectors. Increased rainfall creates more habitat for mosquitoes that transmit diseases like malaria, but too much rain washes away the habitat. Decreased rainfall also increases disease risk when people without reliable access to water use containers to store water where mosquitoes, such as the vectors of dengue fever Aedes aegypti and A. albopictus, lay their eggs. Hotter temperatures also increase mosquito-bite rate, parasite development and viral replication! Certain species of snails are intermediate hosts for many helminth parasites that make humans, livestock and wild animals sick. When it gets hot, the snails can produce 2–3 times as many infective larvae; however, if it becomes too hot, many pathogens and their vectors cannot survive or reproduce."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.1.4_p1,malaria;infectious disease,"Multiple studies predict increases in disease incidence or geographic and phenological changes of pathogens, vectors and reservoir host species due to climate change with or without other non-climatic variables (González et al., 2010; Moo-Llanes et al., 2013; Roy-Dufresne et al., 2013; Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014; Laporta et al., 2015; Ryan et al., 2015; Haydock et al., 2016; Hoover and Barker, 2016; Prist et al., 2017; Blum and Hotez, 2018; Dumic and Severnini, 2018; Hundessa et al., 2018; Ryan et al., 2019; Ryan et al., 2021). However, models predicting changes in infectious disease risk are complex and sometimes produce conflicting results and lack consensus (Caminade et al., 2014; Giesen et al., 2020). For example, malaria is projected to increase in some regions of Africa, Asia and South America by the end of the 21st century if public health interventions are not sufficient, but is also forecasted to decrease in some higher-risk areas (Cross-Chapter Box Illness in this chapter) (Peterson, 2009; Caminade et al., 2014; Ryan et al., 2015; Khormi and Kumar, 2016; Leedale et al., 2016; Murdock et al., 2016; Endo and Eltahir, 2020; Mordecai et al., 2020)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.1.4_p2,malaria;lyme disease;west nile fever;ross river fever,"While malaria risk is predicted to decrease in some lowland tropical areas as temperatures become too hot for vector or parasite development, other warm-adapted diseases, like dengue and Zika, transmitted by A. aegypti, are predicted to increase (Cross-Chapter Box Illness in this chapter, chapter 7) (Ryan et al., 2019; Ryan et al., 2021). In more temperate regions, arboviruses and other VBDs with wider thermal breadths, such as West Nile fever, Ross River fever and Lyme disease, are predicted to increase with climate warming (Ogden et al., 2008; Leighton et al., 2012; Shocket et al., 2018; Shocket et al., 2020; Couper et al., 2021). Drought can exacerbate these effects of temperature (Paull et al., 2017)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.4_p2,malaria,"Online tools are being developed to warn conservation biologists when species of conservation concern are at a greater risk of disease outbreaks due to environmental changes, for example, for Hawaiian honeycreepers and avian malaria (Berio Fortini et al., 2020) and coral diseases (Caldwell et al., 2016). Forecasting models to warn of human disease outbreaks like malaria and dengue are also now available, with findings that multiple-model ensemble forecasts outperform individual models (Lowe et al., 2013; Lowe et al., 2014; Lowe et al., 2018; Zhai et al., 2018; Johansson et al., 2019; Tompkins et al., 2019; Muñoz et al., 2020; Colón-González et al., 2021; Petrova et al., 2021). Improving VBD and NTD public health responses will require multi-disciplinary teams capable of interpreting, analysing, and synthesising diverse components of complex ecosystem-based studies for effective intervention (Mills et al., 2010; Rubin et al., 2014; Valenzuela and Aksoy, 2018), broad epidemiological and entomological surveillance (Depaquit et al., 2010; Lindgren et al., 2012; Springer et al., 2016) as well as community-based disease control programmes that build local capacity (Andersson et al., 2015; Jones et al., 2020b)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.2_p5,malaria,"Changes in weather and climatic patterns are negatively affecting human health in CSA, in part through the emergence of diseases in previously non-endemic areas (WGII AR5 Chapter 27, Magrin et al., 2014). Projections of potential impacts of climate change on malaria confirm that weather and climate are among the drivers of geographic range, intensity of transmission, and seasonality; the changes of risk become more complex with additional warming (very high confidence) (SR15 Chapter 3, Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018). There is high confidence that constraining the warming to 1.5°C would reduce risks for unique and threatened ecosystems safeguarding the services they provide for livelihoods and sustainable development (food, water) in CA and Amazon (SR15 Chapter 5, Roy et al., 2018)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.3.1.4_p4,malaria;leishmaniasis;rabies,"Studies have shown that the incidence of some vector-borne and zoonotic diseases in CA is correlated to climatic variables, particularly temperature and rainfall (high confidence) (Figure 12.4; Table 12.1). In Honduras, rainfall and relative humidity were positively correlated with the occurrence of haemorrhagic dengue cases (Zambrano et al., 2012). In Costa Rica, temperature and rainfall were correlated to cattle rabies outbreaks and mortality during 1985–2016 (Hutter et al., 2018); incidence of leishmaniasis showed cycles of 3 years related to temperature changes (Chaves and Pascual, 2006); and snakebites were more likely to occur at high temperatures and were significantly reduced after the rainy season for the period 2005–2013 (Chaves et al., 2015). In Panama, rainfall was associated with an increased number of malaria cases among the Gunas, an Indigenous People with high vulnerability living in poverty conditions on small islands affected by SLR (Hurtado et al., 2018). These correlations point to a possible change in disease incidence with climate change; evidence of that change is yet to be reported in the literature because longitudinal studies are lacking in the region."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.3.2.4_p5,malaria;chikungunya;leptospirosis;tuberculosis,"Increases in vector-borne diseases can be related to increases in rainfall and minimum temperatures during ENSO events (Stewart-Ibarra and Lowe, 2013) and the expansion of the diseases’ altitudinal distribution (high confidence) (Lowe et al., 2017; Lippi et al., 2019; Portilla Cabrera and Selvaraj, 2020). ENSO events have been related to such diseases as dengue and leptospirosis (Quintero-Herrera et al., 2015; Sánchez et al., 2017; Arias-Monsalve and Builes-Jaramillo, 2019); they can also lead to an increased incidence of chikungunya (Sections 7.2.2.1 and 7.3.1.3). Precipitation, relative humidity and temperature have influenced dengue incidence in recent years (Mattar et al., 2013) (Table 12.1). Dengue cases are predicted to increase in the 1.5°C and the 3.7°C warming scenarios by 2050 and 2100, with increases ranging from 28,900 to 88,800 in Peru, 34,600 to 110,000 in Ecuador, and 97,400 to 317,000 in Colombia, although these scenarios do not consider the potential effects of vaccines or socioeconomic trajectories (Colón-González et al., 2018). Other studies found that Aedes aegypti (arbovirus vector) will shift into higher elevations, increasing the populations at risk (Figure 12.5) (Lippi et al., 2019). Climate change will contribute to increased malaria vectorial capacity (high confidence) (Section 7.2.2.1) (Laporta et al., 2015). Increases in minimum temperature were associated with historical malaria transmission when taking into consideration disease control interventions and climate factors (Fletcher et al., 2020). Figure 12.4 shows mixed changes in the number of months suitable for malaria transmission, with low-lying areas in coastal regions becoming more suitable. Zoonotic tick-borne diseases and the epidemiology of tuberculosis are also influenced (Garcia-Solorzano et al., 2019; Rodriguez-Morales et al., 2019)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.3.3.4_p3,malaria;leishmaniasis,"Several vector-driven diseases such as malaria and leishmaniasis are endemic in the Amazon region; however, socio-environmental changes are altering their natural dynamics (Confalonieri et al., 2014b). An important relationship between the outbreak of infectious diseases and changes in climatic events (e.g., droughts, floods, heat waves, ENSO) or environmental events (e.g., deforestation, dam construction and habitat fragmentation) has been found to exist for the Brazilian Amazon (medium confidence: medium evidence, high agreement ) (Pan et al., 2014; Filho et al., 2016; Nava et al., 2017; Ellwanger et al., 2020). These impacts are more severe in poor populations with limited access to health services (Pan et al., 2014; WHO and UNFCCC, 2020). In the case of Venezuela, the impact of climate change on the epidemiology of malaria has been studied, showing significant influence on transmission in the Amazonia area of the country (Figure 12.4) (Laguna et al., 2017). Other studies from Venezuela have documented the role of ENSO in dengue outbreaks (Vincenti-Gonzalez et al., 2018). Table 12.1 shows the changes observed in reproduction potential for dengue in the different sub-regions due to changes in rainfall and temperature. Forest fires pose a major threat to public health in the region because they relate to an increase in hospital admissions due to respiratory problems, mainly among children and the elderly (Figure 12.5). The amount of air pollutants detected is sometimes higher than that observed in large urban areas, especially during dry seasons when biomass burning increases (Aragão et al., 2016; de Oliveira Alves et al., 2017; Paralovo et al., 2019)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.6.2_p1,malaria,"Integrated climate–health surveillance systems are another key adaptation strategy (medium confidence). This information can be used by the health sector to inform decision-making about when and where to deploy a public health intervention. It can also feed into an EWS, particularly if the data are compatible in format and spatiotemporal scales. An integrated climate–health surveillance system for vector-borne disease control was developed in southern coastal Ecuador through a partnership among the climate and health sectors and academia (Borbor-Cordova et al., 2016; Lowe et al., 2017). Additionally, an interdisciplinary multi-national team working at the border of Ecuador and Peru created a cooperation network for climate-informed dengue surveillance (Quichi et al., 2016), and their successful binational collaboration resulted in the local elimination of malaria (Krisher et al., 2016). A similar tool is innovative community-based data collection to understand and find solutions to rainfall-related diarrheal diseases in Ecuador (Palacios et al., 2016)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.6.3_p1,malaria,"Vulnerability and risk maps have been widely used as an adaptation strategy to understand the potential impacts of climate on health outcomes both directly (e.g., maps of disease risk) and indirectly (e.g., maps of populations vulnerable to climate disasters) (high confidence). There are many examples of where climate services have been used to construct vulnerability maps for health outcomes, including maps in the aforementioned climate–health observatories. Dengue, malaria and Zika vulnerability maps using climate, social and environmental information have been developed in Brazil and Colombia (Cunha et al., 2016b; López-Álvarez, 2016; Pereda, 2016; IDEAM, 2017). Argentina focuses on improving its health system using a climate change risk map system as a tool that identifies the risks and allows assessing their management (OPS and WHO, 2018)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.6.4_p4,malaria;dengue fever,"Participatory management can be relevant in the case of mosquito-borne disease prevention (e.g., dengue fever or malaria), where the reduction in mosquito habitat in one area or ‘hotspot’ can reduce the risk for all surrounding households. This approach is also relevant when considering new places where vector-borne diseases can emerge because of changes in climate (Andersson et al., 2015)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.6.4_p6,malaria,"Another example of a public adaptation measure is the protection and restoration of natural areas, which have the potential to decrease the transmission of water- and vector-borne infectious diseases (medium confidence: robust evidence, low agreement ). Studies have shown that these measures can diminish the cases of malaria and diarrhoea in Brazil and cases of diarrhoea in children in Colombia (Bauch et al., 2015; Herrera et al., 2017; Chaves et al., 2018). However, deforestation and malaria have a complex relationship that relies on local context interactions, where land use and land cover changes play an important role due to vector ecology alterations and social conditions of human settlements (Rubio-Palis et al., 2013). Forest conservation can improve hydrological cycle control and soil erosion that can help to improve water quality and reduce the burden of water-borne diseases. In addition, forest cover can help to diminish the habitat for larval mosquitoes that transmit malaria. These measures can help to design policies at sites where these problems do not currently exist but can emerge as a consequence of climate change and the increase in the frequency of weather extreme events."

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.3.4.4_p5,asthma;leptospirosis;dermatitis,"Observations from recent past droughts in SAM indicate how the incidence of respiratory diseases may worsen under a drier and warmer climate. Northwest SAM had an approximately 54% increase in the incidence of respiratory diseases associated with forest fires during the 2005 drought compared to a no-drought 10-year mean (high confidence) (Ignotti et al., 2010; Pereira et al., 2011; Smith et al., 2014). It is estimated that more than 10 million people are exposed to forest fires in the deforestation arc, a region comprising several Brazilian states in the southern and western parts of the Amazon rainforest, with several impacts on human health including potential exacerbation of the COVID-19 crisis in Amazonia (medium confidence: medium evidence, high agreement ) (de Oliveira et al., 2020) (Table 12.5). Increases in hospital admissions, asthma, DNA damage and lung cell death due to the inhalation of fine particulate matter  represent an increase in public health system costs (high confidence) (Ignotti et al., 2010; Silva et al., 2013; de Oliveira Alves et al., 2017; Machin et al., 2019). The patchy landscape created by forest clearing contributes to a rising risk of zoonotic disease emergence by increasing interactions between wildlife, livestock and humans (medium confidence: low evidence, medium agreement ) (Dobson et al., 2020; Tollefson, 2020). Recent studies also suggest an influence of climate change in zoonotic diseases, such as Orthohantavirus and Chapare viral infections, rodent-borne diseases, in some areas of Bolivia (Escalera-Antezana et al., 2020a; Escalera-Antezana et al., 2020b). Extreme fluctuations in Amazon River levels were associated with a significant increase in the incidence of diarrhoea, leptospirosis and dermatitis (de Souza Hacon et al., 2019; Government of Brazil, 2020). According to a comprehensive characterisation of future heatwaves and alternative RCPs scenarios, Brazilian urban areas in the SAM region are projected to face increasing related mortality from 400% to 500% in the period 2031–2080 compared to the period 1971–2020, under the highest emission scenario and high-variant population scenario (medium confidence: low evidence, medium agreement ) (Guo et al., 2018). Table 12.2 shows the increase in days of exposure to heatwaves already observed in the region."

Climate-driven forecast models have been developed for dengue in Ecuador, Puerto Rico, Peru, Brazil, Mexico, Dominican Republic, and Colombia (Lowe et al., 2013; Eastin et al., 2014; Johansson et al., 2016; Lowe et al., 2017; Johansson et al., 2019); for Zika virus infections across the Americas (Muñoz et al., 2017); for cutaneous leishmaniasis in Costa Rica and Brazil (Chaves and Pascual, 2006; Lewnard et al., 2014); for Aedes-borne diseases across the Americas (Muñoz et al., 2020b); and a nowcast model for chikungunya virus infections across the Americas (Johansson et al., 2014). In Ecuador, a prototype system utilised forecasts of seasonal climate and ENSO forecasts of to predict dengue transmission, providing the health sector with warnings of increased transmission several months ahead of time (Stewart-Ibarra and Lowe, 2013; Lowe et al., 2017). Despite these advances, few tools have become operational and mainstreamed in decision making processes. However, Brazil and Panama have been able to operationalise an EWS for the surveillance of dengue fever transmission (Codeço et al., 2016; McDonald et al., 2016)."

This can lead to novel disease emergence in new places, more frequent and larger outbreaks, and longer or shifted seasons of transmission. Climate change is making it possible for many EIDs to colonise historically colder areas that are becoming warmer and wetter in temperate and polar regions and in the mountains. Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are diseases spread by vectors such as mosquitoes, sand flies, kissing bugs and ticks. For example, ticks that carry the virus that causes tick-borne encephalitis have moved into the northern subarctic regions of Asia and Europe. Viruses like dengue, chikungunya and Japanese encephalitis are emerging in Nepal in hilly and mountainous areas. Novel outbreaks of Vibrio bacteria seafood poisoning are being traced to the the Baltic States and Alaska where they were never documented before. Many scientific studies show that the transmission of infectious disease and the number of individuals infected depends on rainfall and temperature; climate change often makes these conditions more favourable for disease transmission."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.1.4_p3,chikungunya;yellow fever,"A global analysis of 7346 wildlife populations and 2021 host–parasite combinations found that organisms adapted to cool and mild climates are likely to experience increased risks of outbreaks along with climate warming, while warm-adapted organisms may experience a lower disease risk, providing further support for predictions that climate change will increase the transmission of infectious diseases at higher latitudes across a taxonomically diverse array of pathogens (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Cohen et al., 2020). A study examining the future risk of arboviruses (chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever and Zika viruses) spread by A. aegypti and A. albopictus projected increased disease risk due to interactions of multiple variables, including increased human connectivity, urbanisation and climate change (Kraemer et al., 2019), although vector species’ ranges will broaden only slightly (Campbell et al., 2015)."

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.2.6_p7,melanism,"Several lines of evidence suggest the evolution of melanism in response to climate change (low confidence), with colour changes associated with thermoregulation being demonstrated in butterflies (Zeuss et al., 2014; MacLean et al., 2016; MacLean et al., 2019a), beetles (de Jong and Brakefield, 1998; Brakefield and de Jong, 2011; Zvereva et al., 2019), dragonflies (Zeuss et al., 2014) and phasmids (Nosil et al., 2018). Such changes may represent decreased phenotypic diversity and, potentially, genetic diversity (low confidence), but the consequences of climate change for the genetic structure and diversity of populations have not been widely assessed (Pauls et al., 2013). Simplistically, the thermal melanism hypothesis suggests that lighter (higher-reflectance) individuals should be fitter and therefore be selected for in a warmer climate (Clusella-Trullas et al., 2007). However, several biotic (e.g., thermoregulatory requirements, predator avoidance and signalling) and abiotic (e.g., UV, moisture and inter-annual variability) factors interact to influence changes in colour, making attribution to climate change across species and broad geographic regions difficult (Kingsolver and Buckley, 2015; Stuart-Fox et al., 2017; Clusella-Trullas and Nielsen, 2020)."

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.4.2.1_p1,respiratory disease,"Wildfire is a natural and essential component of many forest and other terrestrial ecosystems. Excessive wildfire, however, can kill people, cause respiratory disease, destroy houses, emit carbon dioxide and damage ecosystem integrity (see Sections 2.4.4.2 and 2.4.4.4). Anthropogenic climate change increases wildfire by exacerbating its three principal driving factors: heat, fuel and ignition (Moritz et al., 2012; Jolly et al., 2015). Non-climatic factors also contribute to wildfires—in tropical areas, fires are set intentionally to clear forest for agricultural fields and livestock pastures (Bowman et al., 2020). Urban areas and roads create ignition hazards. Governments in many temperate-zone countries implement policies to suppress fires, even natural ones, producing unnatural accumulations of fuel in the form of coarse woody debris and high densities of small trees (Ruffault and Mouillot, 2015; Hessburg et al., 2016; Andela et al., 2017; Balch et al., 2017; Lasslop and Kloster, 2017; Aragao et al., 2018; Kelley et al., 2019). Globally, 4.2 million km 2 of land per year burned on average from 2002 to 2016 (Giglio et al., 2018), with the highest fire frequencies in the Amazon rainforest, deciduous forests and savannas in Africa and deciduous forests in northern Australia (Earl and Simmonds, 2018; Andela et al., 2019)."

The evidence for the connection between household crowding and the risk of contagion from infectious diseases is also strong. A 2018 World Health Organization (WHO) systematic review of the effect of household crowding on health concluded that a majority of studies of the risk of non-tuberculosis infectious diseases, including flu-related illnesses, were associated with household crowding (Shannon et al. 2018)."
