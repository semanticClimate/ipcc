cleaned_content/wg1/Chapter03#3.2.2_p1,carbon dioxide;climate system,"Considering the difficulty in accounting for climate modelling uncertainties in the regression-based approaches, Ribes et al. (2017) introduced a new statistical inference framework based on an additivity assumption and likelihood maximization, which estimates climate model uncertainty based on an ensemble of opportunity and tests whether observations are inconsistent with internal variability and consistent with the expected response from climate models. The method was further developed by Ribes et al. (2021), who applied it to narrow the uncertainty range in the estimated human-induced warming. Hannart and Naveau (2018), on the other hand, extended the application of standard causal theory (Pearl, 2009) to the context of detection and attribution by converting a time series into an event, and calculating the probability of causation, an approach which maximizes the causal evidence associated with the forcing. On the other hand, Schurer et al. (2018) employed a Bayesian framework to explicitly consider climate modelling uncertainty in the optimal regression method. Application of these approaches to attribution of large-scale temperature changes supports a dominant anthropogenic contribution to the observed global warming."

A levelling off of atmospheric water vapour over land in the last two decades that needed better understanding, and remaining observational uncertainties, precluded a more confident assessment (Bindoff et al., 2013). Sections 4.5.1.3 and 8.3.1.4 show that there have been significant advances in the understanding of the processes controlling land surface humidity. In particular, there has been a focus on the role of oceanic moisture transport and land-atmosphere feedbacks in explaining the observed trends in relative humidity."

This showed a strong upper ocean (<300 m) negative salinity (fresh) bias of order 0.3 PSS-78, with a tendency toward a positive salinity (salty) bias (<0.25 PSS-78) in the Northern Hemisphere intermediate layers (200–3000 m) (Flato et al., 2013). These biases are also present in CMIP6, albeit with slightly smaller magnitudes (Figure 3.25). Here we expand the global zonal mean bias assessment to consider the three independent ocean basins individually, which allows for an assessment as to which basin biases are dominating the global zonal mean. The basin with the most pronounced biases is the Atlantic, with a strong upper ocean (<300 m) fresh bias, of order 0.3 PSS-78 just like the global zonal mean, and a marked subsurface salinity bias that exceeds 0.5 PSS-78 in equatorial waters between 400–1000 m."

The Indian Ocean shows similar features to the Southern Hemisphere Pacific, with a marked upper ocean (<500 m) fresh bias of order 0.3 PSS-78, and a strong near-surface positive bias of order 0.4 PSS-78 associated with the Arabian Sea (Figure 3.25)."

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.4.2.1_p1,carbon dioxide;anthropogenic;anthropogenic climate change,"Wildfire is a natural and essential component of many forest and other terrestrial ecosystems. Excessive wildfire, however, can kill people, cause respiratory disease, destroy houses, emit carbon dioxide and damage ecosystem integrity (see Sections 2.4.4.2 and 2.4.4.4). Anthropogenic climate change increases wildfire by exacerbating its three principal driving factors: heat, fuel and ignition (Moritz et al., 2012; Jolly et al., 2015). Non-climatic factors also contribute to wildfires—in tropical areas, fires are set intentionally to clear forest for agricultural fields and livestock pastures (Bowman et al., 2020). Urban areas and roads create ignition hazards. Governments in many temperate-zone countries implement policies to suppress fires, even natural ones, producing unnatural accumulations of fuel in the form of coarse woody debris and high densities of small trees (Ruffault and Mouillot, 2015; Hessburg et al., 2016; Andela et al., 2017; Balch et al., 2017; Lasslop and Kloster, 2017; Aragao et al., 2018; Kelley et al., 2019). Globally, 4.2 million km 2 of land per year burned on average from 2002 to 2016 (Giglio et al., 2018), with the highest fire frequencies in the Amazon rainforest, deciduous forests and savannas in Africa and deciduous forests in northern Australia (Earl and Simmonds, 2018; Andela et al., 2019)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.3.2.2_p6,carbon dioxide,"In the USA, climate change under RCP8.5 could increase the burned area by 60–80% by 2049 (Buotte et al., 2019) and the number of fires with an area >50 km 2 by 300–400% by 2070 (Barbero et al., 2015). In montane forests, climate change under RCP8.5 increases the risk of fire-facilitated conversion of ~7% of forest to non-forest by 2050 (Parks et al., 2019). In California, climate change under a scenario of a 4°C temperature increase could double fire frequency in some areas (Mann et al., 2016), but emission reductions that limit the temperature increase to ~2°C could keep this from increasing (Westerling et al., 2011). Carbon dioxide fertilisation and increased temperature under climate change could increase invasive grasses and wildfire in desert ecosystems of the southwestern USA where wildfire has historically been absent or infrequent, and increase the mortality of the sparse tree cover (Horn and St. Clair, 2017; Klinger and Brooks, 2017; Syphard et al., 2017; Moloney et al., 2019; Sweet et al., 2019)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.4_p4,carbon dioxide,"Key risks assessed here are interconnected. Extinction of species is an irreversible impact of climate change and has negative consequences on ecosystem integrity and functioning, and the risks increase steeply with even small rises in global temperature  (Section 2.5.1.3, Figure 2.6, Figure 2.7, Figure 2.8). Continued climate change substantially increases the risk of carbon losses due to wildfires, tree mortality from drought and insect pest outbreaks, peatland drying, permafrost thaw and changes in the structure of ecosystems; these could exacerbate self-reinforcing feedbacks between emissions from high-carbon ecosystems and increasing global temperatures (medium confidence). Thawing of Arctic permafrost alone could release 11–200 GtC (medium confidence). Complex interactions of climate changes, LULCC, carbon dioxide fluxes and vegetation changes will regulate the future carbon balance of the biosphere, processes incompletely represented in ESMs. The exact timing and magnitude of climate–biosphere feedbacks and the potential tipping points of carbon loss are characterised by broad ranges of the estimates, but studies indicate that increased ecosystem carbon losses could cause extreme future temperature increases (medium confidence).

Therefore, tree planting can be a valuable contribution to reducing climate change. Besides capturing carbon, planting trees can reduce some negative impacts of climate change by providing shade and cooling.

A high overshoot of 1.5°C increases the risks from climate impacts and increases the dependence on large-scale carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere. A future consistent with NDCs announced prior to COP26 implies higher fossil fuel deployment and lower reliance on low-carbon alternatives until 2030, compared to mitigation pathways with immediate action to limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower. To limit warming to 2°C (>67%) after following the NDCs to 2030, the pace of global GHG emission reductions would need to accelerate rapidly from 2030 onward: to an average of 1.4–2.0 GtCO2-eq yr –1 between 2030 and 2050, which is around two-thirds of the global CO2 emission reductions in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and around 70% faster than in immediate action pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%). Accelerating emission reductions after following an NDC pathway to 2030 would be particularly challenging because of the continued buildup of fossil fuel infrastructure that would be expected to take place between now and 2030. {3.5, 4.2}"
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.2.2_p1,carbon dioxide;climate system,"Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are critical for understanding the implications of long-term climate objectives for the required near-term transition. For doing so, an integrated systems perspective including the representation of all sectors and GHGs is necessary. IAMs are used to explore the response of complex systems in a formal and consistent framework. They cover a broad range of modelling frameworks (Keppo et al. 2021). Given the complexity of the systems under investigation, IAMs necessarily make simplifying assumptions and therefore results need to be interpreted in the context of these assumptions. IAMs can range from economic models that consider only carbon dioxide emissions through to detailed process-based representations of the global energy system, covering separate regions and sectors (such as energy, transport, and land use), all GHG emissions and air pollutants, interactions with land and water, and a reduced representation of the climate system. IAMs are generally driven by economics and can have a variety of characteristics such as partial-, general- or non-equilibrium; myopic or perfect foresight; be based on optimisation or simulation; have exogenous or endogenous technological change amongst many other characteristics. IAMs take as input socio-economic and technical variables and parameters to represent various systems. There is no unique way to integrate this knowledge into a model, and due to their complexity, various simplifications and omissions are made for tractability. IAMs therefore have various advantages and disadvantages which need to be weighed up when interpreting IAM outcomes.

Other IMPs illustrate the implications of a less rapid introduction of mitigation measures followed by a subsequent gradual strengthening (IMP-GS), and how shifting global pathways towards sustainable development, including by reducing inequality, can lead to mitigation (IMP-SP) In the IMP framework, IMP-GS is consistent with limiting warming to 2°C (>67%) (C3), IMP-Neg shows a strategy that also limits warming to 2°C (>67%) but returns to nearly 1.5°C (>50%) by the end of the century (hence indicated as C2*). The other variants that can limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) (C1) were selected. In addition to these IMPs, sensitivity cases that explore alternative warming levels (C3) for IMP-Neg and IMP-Ren are assessed (IMP-Neg-2.0 and IMP-Ren-2.0)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.3.2.2_p1,carbon dioxide;greenhouse gas,"The trajectory of future CO2 emissions plays a critical role in mitigation, given CO2 long-term impact and dominance in total greenhouse gas forcing. As shown in Figure 3.12, CO2 dominates total greenhouse gas emissions in the high-emissions scenarios but is also reduced most, going from scenarios in the highest to lower categories. In C4 and below, most scenarios exhibit net negative CO2 emissions in the second half of the century compensating for some of the residual emissions of non-CO2 gases as well as reducing overall warming from an intermediate peak. Still, early emission reductions and further reductions in non-CO2 emissions can also lead to scenarios without net negative emissions in 2100, even in C1 and C3 (shown for the 85–95th percentile). In C1, avoidance of significant overshoot implies that immediate gross reductions are more relevant than long-term net negative emissions (explaining the lower number than in C2) but carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is still playing a role in compensating for remaining positive emissions in hard-to-abate sectors."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#box-3.4_p5,carbon dioxide,"The AR6 WGI estimated the remaining carbon budgets from their assessment of (i) the transient climate response to cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide (TCRE), and estimates of (ii) the historical human-induced warming, (iii) the temperature change after reaching net zero CO2 emissions, (iv) the contribution of future non-CO2 warming (derived from the emissions scenarios assessed in the Special Report on 1.5°C Warming using WGI-calibrated emulators), and (v) the Earth System feedbacks (AR6 WGI Chapter 5.5, Box 5.2). For a given warming level, AR6 WGI assessed the remaining carbon budget from the beginning of 2020 onwards. These are 650/500/400 GtCO2 for limiting warming to 1.5°C with 33%/50%/ 67% chance and 1350/1150 GtCO2 for limiting warming to 2°C with 50%/67% chance. The estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty related to historical warming, future non-CO2 forcing, and poorly quantified climate feedbacks. For instance, variation in non-CO2 emissions across scenarios are estimated to either increase or decrease the remaining carbon budget estimates by 220 GtCO2. The estimates of the remaining carbon budget assume that non-CO2 emissions are reduced consistently with the tight temperature targets for which the budgets are estimated."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#cross-chapter-box-3_p2,carbon dioxide;greenhouse gas,"This Cross-Chapter Box surveys scientific, technical and policy aspects of net zero carbon dioxide (CO2) and net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with a focus on timing, the relationship with warming levels, and sectoral and regional characteristics of net zero emissions. Assessment of net zero GHG emissions additionally requires consideration of non-CO2 gases and choice of GHG emission metrics used to aggregate emissions and removals of different GHGs (Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 2 and Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 10). The following considers net zero CO2 and GHG emissions globally, followed by regional and sectoral dimensions."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#cross-chapter-box-3_p17,carbon dioxide;Deforestation,"The timing of net zero CO2or GHG emissions may differ across regions and sectors. Achieving net zero emissions globally implies that some sectors and regions must reach net zero CO2or GHG ahead of the time of global net zero CO2or GHG if others reach it later.  Similarly, some sectors and regions would need to achieve net negative CO2 or GHG emissions to compensate for continued emissions by other sectors and regions after the global net zero year. Differences in the timing to reach net zero emissions between sectors and regions depend on multiple factors, including the potential of countries and sectors to reduce GHG emissions and undertake carbon dioxide removal (CDR), the associated costs, and the availability of policy mechanisms to balance emissions and removals between sectors and countries (Fyson et al. 2020; Strefler et al. 2021a; van Soest et al. 2021b). A lack of such mechanisms could lead to higher global costs to reach net zero emissions globally, but less interdependencies and institutional needs (Fajardy and Mac Dowell 2020). Sectors will reach net zero CO2 and GHG emissions at different times if they are aiming for such targets with sector-specific policies or as part of an economy-wide net zero emissions strategy integrating emissions reductions and removals across sectors. In the latter case, sectors with large potential for achieving net negative emissions would go beyond net zero to balance residual emissions from sectors with low potential, which in turn would take more time compared to the case of sector-specific action. Global pathways project global AFOLU emissions to reach global net zero CO2 the earliest, around 2030 to 2035 in pathways to limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower, by rapid reduction of deforestation and enhancing carbon sinks on land, although net zero GHG emissions from global AFOLU are typically reached 30 years later, if at all. The ability of global AFOLU CO2 emissions to reach net zero as early as in the 2030s in modelled pathways hinges on optimistic assumptions about the ability to establish global cost-effective mechanisms to balance emissions reductions and removals across regions and sectors. These assumptions have been challenged in the literature and the Special Report on Climate Change and Land (IPCC SRCCL)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#cross-chapter-box-3_p20,carbon dioxide;anthropogenic,"The accounting of anthropogenic carbon dioxide removal on land matters for the evaluation of net zero CO2and net zero GHG strategies. Due to the use of different approaches between national inventories and global models, the current net CO2 emissions are lower by 5.5 GtCO2, and cumulative net CO2 emissions in modelled 1.5°C–2°C pathways would be lower by 104–170 GtCO2, if carbon dioxide removals on land are accounted based on national GHG inventories. National GHG inventories typically consider a much larger area of managed forest than global models, and on this area additionally consider the fluxes due to human-induced global environmental change (indirect effects) to be anthropogenic, while global models consider these fluxes to be natural. Both approaches capture the same land fluxes, only the accounting of anthropogenic vs natural emissions is different. Methods to convert estimates from global models to the accounting scheme of national GHG inventories will improve the use of emission pathways from global models as benchmarks against which collective progress is assessed.

cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.5.2.1_p2,carbon dioxide,"Returning warming to lower levels requires net negative CO2 emissions in the second half of the century (Clarke et al. 2014; Fuss et al. 2014; Rogelj et al. 2018 a). The amount of net negative CO2 emissions in pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C–2°C climate goals varies widely, with some pathways not deploying net negative CO2 emissions at all and others deploying up to –600 to –800 GtCO2. The amount of net negative CO2 emissions tends to increase with 2030 emissions levels (Figure 3.30e and Table 3.6). Studies confirmed the ability of net negative CO2 emissions to reduce warming, but pointed to path dependencies in the storage of carbon and heat in the Earth System and the need for further research particularly for cases of high overshoot (Zickfeld et al. 2016, 2021; Keller et al. 2018a,b; Tokarska et al. 2019). The AR6 WGI assessed the reduction in global surface temperature to be approximately linearly related to cumulative CO2 removal and, with lower confidence, that the amount of cooling per unit CO2 removed is approximately independent of the rate and amount of removal (AR6 WGI TS.3.3.2). Still there remains large uncertainty about a potential asymmetry between the warming response to CO2 emissions and the cooling response to net negative CO2 emissions (Zickfeld et al. 2021). It was also shown that warming can adversely affect the efficacy of carbon dioxide removal measures and hence the ability to achieve net negative CO2 emissions (Boysen et al. 2016)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.5.2.1_p3,carbon dioxide,"Obtaining net negative CO2 emissions requires massive deployment of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) in the second half of the century, on the order of 220 (160–370) GtCO2 for each 0.1°C degree of cooling (based on the assessment of the likely  range of the transient response to cumulative CO2 emissions in AR6 WGI Section 5.5 in Chapter 5, not taking into account potential asymmetries in the temperature response to CO2 emissions and removals). CDR is assessed in detail in Section 12.3 of this report (see also Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 12). Here we only point to the finding that CDR ramp-up rates and absolute deployment levels are tightly limited by techno-economic, social, political, institutional and sustainability constraints (Smith et al. 2016; Boysen et al. 2017; Fuss et al. 2018, 2020; Nemet et al. 2018; Hilaire et al. 2019; Jia et al. 2019) (Section 12.3). CDR therefore cannot be deployed arbitrarily to compensate any degree of overshoot. A fraction of models was not able to compute pathways that would follow the mitigation ambition in unconditional and conditional NDCs until 2030 and return warming to below 1.5°C by 2100 (Luderer et al. 2018; Roelfsema et al. 2020; Riahi et al. 2021). There exists a three-way trade-off between near-term emissions developments until 2030, transitional challenges during 2030–50, and long-term CDR deployment post-2050 (Sanderson et al. 2016; Holz et al. 2018; Strefler et al. 2018). For example, Strefler et al. (2018) find that if CO2 emission levels stay at around 40 GtCO2 until 2030, within the range of what is projected for NDCs announced prior to COP26, rather than being halved to 20 GtCO2 until 2030, CDR deployment in the second half of the century would have to increase by 50–100%, depending on whether the 2030–2050 CO2 emissions reduction rate is doubled from 6% to 12% or kept at 6% yr –1. This three-way trade-off has also been identified at the national level (Pan et al. 2020)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#cross-working-group-box-1_p3,carbon dioxide;adaptation;weather,"The AR6 WGII also assesses the growing literature estimating the global aggregate economic impacts of climate change and the social cost of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (AR6 WGII Cross-Working Box ECONOMIC: Estimating Global Economic Impacts from Climate Change and the Social Cost of Carbon in AR6 WGII Chapter 16). The former represents aggregate estimates that inform assessment of the economic benefits of mitigation. This literature is characterised by significant variation in the estimates, including for today’s level of global warming, due primarily to fundamental differences in methods, but also differences in impacts included, representation of socio-economic exposure, consideration of adaptation, aggregation approach, and assumed persistence of damages. The AR6 WGII’s assessment identifies different approaches to quantification of aggregated economic impacts of climate change, including: physical modelling of impact processes, such as projected mortality rates from climate risks such as heat, vector- or waterborne diseases that are then monetised; structural economic modelling of impacts on production, consumption, and markets for economic sectors and regional economies; and statistical estimation of impacts based on observed historical responses to weather and climate. The AR6 WGII finds that variation in estimated global economic impacts increases with warming in all methodologies, indicating higher risk in terms of economic impacts at higher temperatures ( high confidence). Many estimates are non-linear with marginal economic impacts increasing with temperature, although some show declining marginal economic impacts with temperature, and functional forms cannot be determined for all studies. The AR6 WGII’s assessment finds that the lack of comparability between methodologies does not allow for identification of robust ranges of global economic impact estimates ( high confidence). Further, AR6 WGII identifies evaluating and reconciling differences in methodologies as a research priority for facilitating use of the different lines of evidence ( high confidence). However, there are estimates that are higher than AR5, indicating that global aggregate economic impacts could be higher than previously estimated (low confidence due to the lack of comparability across methodologies and lack of robustness of estimates) (AR6 WGII Cross-Working Box ECONOMIC)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#FAQ 3.1_p1,carbon dioxide,"Yes. Achieving net zero CO2 emissions and sustaining them into the future is sufficient to stabilise the CO2-induced warming signal which scales with the cumulative net amount of CO2 emissions. At the same time, the warming signal of non-CO2GHGs can be stabilised or reduced by declining emissions that lead to stable or slightly declining concentrations in the atmosphere. For short-lived GHGs with atmospheric lifetimes of less than 20 years, this is achieved when residual emissions are reduced to levels that are lower than the natural removal of these gases in the atmosphere. Taken together, mitigation pathways that bring CO2 emissions to net zero and sustain it, while strongly reducing non-CO2GHGs to levels that stabilise or decline their aggregate warming contribution, will stabilise warming without using net negative CO2 emissions and with positive overall GHG emissions when aggregated using GWP-100. A considerable fraction of pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot and limit warming to 2°C (>67%), respectively, do not or only marginally (<10 GtCO2 cumulative until 2100) deploy net negative CO2 emissions (26% and 46%, respectively) and do not reach net zero GHG emissions by the end of the century (48% and 70%, respectively). This is no longer the case in pathways that return warming to 1.5°C (>50%) after a high overshoot (typically >0.1°C). All of these pathways deploy net negative emissions on the order of 360 (60–680) GtCO2 (median and 5–95th percentile) and 87% achieve net negative GHGs emissions in AR6 GWP-100 before the end of the century. Hence, global net negative CO2 emissions, and net zero or net negative GHG emissions, are only needed to decline, not to stabilise global warming. The deployment of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is distinct from the deployment of net negative CO2 emissions, because it is also used to neutralise residual CO2 emissions to achieve and sustain net zero CO2 emissions. CDR deployment can be considerable in pathways without net negative emissions and all pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C use it to some extent."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#FAQ 3.2_p3,carbon dioxide,"Not all regions and sectors must reach net zero CO2 or GHG emissions individually to achieve global net zero CO2 or GHG emissions, respectively; instead, positive emissions in one sector or region can be compensated by net negative emissions from another sector or region. The time each sector or region reaches net zero CO2 or GHG emissions depends on the mitigation options available, the cost of those options, and the policies implemented (including any consideration of equity or fairness). Most modelled pathways that likely  limit warming to 2°C (>67%) above pre-industrial levels and below use land-based CO2 removal such as afforestation/reforestation and BECCS to achieve net zero CO2 and net zero GHG emissions even while some CO2 and non-CO2 emissions continue to occur. Pathways with more demand-side interventions that limit the amount of energy we use, or where the diet that we consume is changed, can achieve net zero CO2, or net zero GHG emissions with less carbon dioxide removal (CDR). All available studies require at least some kind of carbon dioxide removal to reach net zero; that is, there are no studies where absolute zero GHG or even CO2 emissions are reached by deep emissions reductions alone."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#executive-summary_p3,carbon dioxide;methane;carbon footprint,"The urban share of global GHG emissions (including carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4)) is substantive and continues to increase (high confidence). In 2015, urban emissions were estimated to be 25 GtCO2-eq (about 62% of the global share) and in 2020, 29 GtCO2-eq (67–72% of the global share). 1 About 100 of the highest emitting urban areas account for approximately 18% of the global carbon footprint. {8.1.6, 8.3.3}"
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.1.1_p2,carbon dioxide;climate change mitigation,"Since AR5, there has been growing scientific literature and policy foci on urban strategies for climate change mitigation. There are three possible reasons for this. First, according to AR5 Working Group III (WGIII) Chapter 12 on Human Settlements, Infrastructure, and Spatial Planning, urban areas generate between 71% and 76% of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from global final energy use and between 67% and 76% of global energy (Seto et al. 2014). Thus, focusing on ‘urban systems’ (see Annex I: Glossary and Figure 8.15) addresses one of the key drivers of emissions. Second, more than half of the world population lives in urban areas, and by mid-century 7 out of 10 people on the planet will live in a town or a city (UN DESA 2019). Thus, coming up with mitigation strategies that are relevant to urban settlements is critical for successful mitigation of climate change. Third, beyond climate change, there is growing attention on cities as major catalysts of change and to help achieve the objectives outlined in multiple international frameworks and assessments."

This low signal-to-noise ratio hinders the emergence of the anthropogenic signal from natural variability. Moreover, the sign of the change depends on location and time of the year. Paleoclimate records provide valuable context for observed trends in the 20th and 21st century and assist with the attribution of these trends to human influence (see also (Section 2.3.1.3.1). By nature, hydrological proxy data represent regional conditions, but taken together can represent large-scale patterns. As an example of how paleorecords have helped assessing the origin of changes, we consider some, mainly subtropical, regions which have experienced systematic drying in recent decades (see also Section 8.3.1.3). Paleoclimate simulations of monsoons are assessed in Section 3.3.3.2."
cleaned_content/wg1/Chapter03#3.3.2.2_p5,global warming ;methane,"Dunn et al. (2017) confirmed earlier findings that global mean surface relative humidity increased between 1973 and 2000, followed by a steep decline (also reported in Willett et al., 2014) until 2013, and specific humidity correspondingly increased and then remained approximately constant (see also (Section 2.3.1.3.2), with none of the CMIP5 models capturing this behaviour. They noted biases in the mean state of the CMIP5 models’ surface relative humidity (and ascribed the failure to the representation of land surface processes and their response to CO2 forcing), concluding that these biases preclude any detection and attribution assessment. On the other hand, Byrne and O’Gorman (2018) showed that the positive trend in specific humidity continued in recent years and can be detected over land and ocean from 1979 to 2016. Moreover, they provided a theory suggesting that the increase in annual surface temperature and specific humidity as well as the decrease in relative humidity observed over land are linked to warming over the neighbouring ocean. They also pointed out that the negative trend in relative humidity over land regions is quite uncertain and requires further investigation. A recent study has also identified an anthropogenically-driven decrease in relative humidity over the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude continents in summer between 1979 and 2014, which was underestimated by CMIP5 models (Douville and Plazzotta, 2017). Furthermore, in a modelling study Douville et al. (2020) showed that this decrease in boreal summer relative humidity over mid-latitudes is related not only to global ocean warming, but also to the physiological effect of CO2 on plants in the land surface model."

The absence of a direct feedback is one of the primary reasons why salinity simulation is difficult to constrain in ocean modelling systems, and why deviations from the observed near-surface salinity mean state between models and observations are often apparent (Durack et al., 2012; Shi et al., 2017)."

At basin-scales, the depth-integrated effect of mean salinity changes as captured in halosteric sea level for the top 0 to 2000 m has also been assessed based on observational products, and these results mirror near-surface patterns in the CMIP5 and CMIP6 models, with most areas that are becoming fresher at the surface exhibiting increases in halosteric sea level, and areas becoming saltier exhibiting decreases (Durack et al., 2014a; Figure 3.28). Further investigations using observations and models together have tied the long-term patterns of surface and subsurface salinity changes to coincident changes to the evaporation minus precipitation field over the ocean (Durack et al., 2012, 2013; Durack, 2015; Levang and Schmitt, 2015; Zika et al., 2015, 2018; Grist et al., 2016; Lago et al., 2016; Cheng et al., 2020), however the rate of these changes through time continues to be an active area of active research (Skliris et al., 2014; Zika et al., 2015, 2018; Cheng et al., 2020; Sallée et al., 2021)."

cleaned_content/syr/longer-report#2.3.1_p1,global warming ,"Global GHG emissions in 2030 associated with the implementation of NDCs announced prior to COP2691  would make it likely that warming will exceed 1. 5°C during the 21st century and would make it harder to limit warming below 2°C – if no additional commitments are made or actions taken (Figure 2.5, Table 2.2). A substantial ‘emissions gap’ exists as global GHG emissions in 2030 associated with the implementation of NDCs announced prior to COP26 would be similar to or only slightly below 2019 emission levels and higher than those associated with modelled mitigation pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot or to 2°C (>67%), assuming immediate action, which implies deep, rapid, and sustained global GHG emission reductions this decade (high confidence). (Table 2.2, Table 3.1, 4.1). 92 The magnitude of the emissions gap depends on the global warming level considered and whether only unconditional or also conditional elements of NDCs 93  are considered (high confidence) (Table 2.2). Modelled pathways that are consistent with NDCs announced prior to COP26 until 2030 and assume no increase in ambition thereafter have higher emissions, leading to a median global warming of 2.8 [2.1 to 3.4]°C by 2100 (medium confidence). If the ‘emission gap’ is not reduced, global GHG emissions in 2030 consistent with NDCs announced prior to COP26 make it likely  that warming will exceed 1.5°C during the 21st century, while limiting warming to 2°C (>67%) would imply an unprecedented acceleration of mitigation efforts during 2030–2050 (medium confidence) (see Section 4.1, Cross-Section Box.2). {WGIII SPM B.6, WGIII SPM B.6.1, WGIII SPM B.6.3, WGIII SPM B.6.4, WGIII SPM C.1.1}"

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.3.3.1_p1,global warming ,"Since AR5, evidence of changes in the temperature of lakes and rivers has continued to increase. Global warming rates for lake surface waters were estimated as 0.21°C–0.45°C per decade between 1970 and 2010, exceeding sea-surface temperature (SST) trends of 0.09°C per decade between 1980 and 2017 (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Figure 2.2; (Schneider and Hook, 2010; Kraemer et al., 2015; O’Reilly et al., 2015; Woolway et al., 2020b). Warming of lake surface water temperatures was variable within regions (O’Reilly et al., 2015) but more homogeneous than deep-water temperature changes (Pilla et al., 2020). Because temperature trends in lakes can vary vertically, horizontally and seasonally, complex changes have occurred in the amount of habitat available to aquatic organisms at particular depths and temperatures (Kraemer et al., 2021)."

Wang et al. (2019) noted, from remote sensing, that during the ‘global warming hiatus’ from 1998 to 2012, there were no global trends in either spring green-up or autumn colouring. Annual crops, the timing of which is determined by farmers, were an exception. When natural systems were advancing fast prior to 1998, farmers advanced more slowly, but during the natural ‘hiatus’, farmed crops advanced faster than wild plants and cultivated trees (Menzel et al., 2020). In a long (67 years) European time series (Menzel et al., 2020), autumn leaf colouring showed delays attributed to winter and spring warming in 57% of observations (mean delay of 0.36 days per decade); spring and summer phenologies advanced in 89% of wild plants, despite decreased winter chilling, with around 60% of trends significant and ‘strongly attributable’ to winter and spring warming; and the growing season lengthened in 84% of cases (mean lengthening 0.26 days yr -1) (Table 2.2)."

(Figure 2.7; Figure 2.8a). Even the lowest estimates of species extinction (median of 9% at 1.5°C warming, Figure 2.7) are 1000 times the natural background rates (De Vos et al., 2015)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.2.10_p2,global warming ,"However, there is an increasing body of literature that has found continued, longer-term responses of ecosystems to climate change, so-called ‘committed changes’, that arise from lags that exist in many systems. Many processes in ecosystems take more than a few decades to quasi-equilibrate to environmental changes. Therefore, the trends of changing vegetation cover identified in simulations of transient warming continue to show up in simulations that hold climate change at low levels of warming (medium confidence) (Boulton et al., 2017; Pugh et al., 2018; Scheiter et al., 2020). Such changes, which could tip ecosystems into an alternative state, could also be triggered by a ‘warming overshoot’ if global warming were to exceed a certain threshold, even if mean temperatures afterwards decline again (Albrich et al., 2020a)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.3.4_p2,global warming ;climate system;feedback,"Enhanced carbon losses from terrestrial systems further limit the available carbon budget for global warming staying below 1.5°C (Rogelj et al., 2018). Analyses of satellite remote sensing and ground-based observations have indicated that, between 1982 and 2015, the CO2 fertilisation effect has already declined, implying a negative climate system feedback (Wang et al., 2020c). Peatlands, permafrost regions and tropical ecosystems are particularly vulnerable due to their large carbon stocks, in combination with over-proportional warming, increases in heat waves and droughts and/or a complex interplay of climate change and increasing atmospheric CO2 (Sections 2.5.2.8, 2.5.2.9, 2.5.3.2)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.3.4_p3,global warming ;carbon cycle,"Model projections suggest a reduction of permafrost extent and potentially large carbon losses for all warming scenarios (Canadell et al., 2021). Already a mean temperature increase of 2°C could reduce the total permafrost area extent by about 5–20% by 2100 (Comyn-Platt et al., 2018; Yokohata et al., 2020). Associated CO2 losses in the order of 15 Gt up to nearly 70 Gt by 2100 have been projected across a number of modelling studies (Schneider von Deimling et al., 2015; Comyn-Platt et al., 2018; Yokohata et al., 2020). Limiting the global temperature increase to 1.5°C versus 2°C could reduce projected permafrost CO2 losses by 2100 by 24.2 Gt (median, calculated for a 3-m depth) (Comyn-Platt et al., 2018). Losses are possibly underestimated in the studies that consider only the upper permafrost layers. Likewise, the actual committed carbon loss may well be larger (e.g., eventually a loss of approx. 40% of today’s permafrost area extent if climate is stabilised at 2°C above pre-industrial levels) due to the long time scale of warming in deep permafrost layers (Chadburn et al., 2017). It is not known at which level of global warming an abrupt permafrost collapse (estimated to enhance CO2 emissions by 40% in 2300 in a high-emissions scenario) compared to gradual thaw (Turetsky et al., 2020) would have to be considered an important additional risk. Large uncertainties arise also from interactions with changes in surface hydrology and/or northward migrating woody vegetation as climate warms, which could dampen or even reverse projected net carbon losses in some regions (McGuire et al., 2018a; Mekonnen et al., 2018; Pugh et al., 2018). Overall, there is low confidence on how carbon–permafrost interactions will affect future carbon cycle and climate, although net carbon losses and thus positive (amplifying) feedbacks are likely  (Sections 2.5.2.10, 2.5.3.5) (Shukla et al., 2019). See also WGI AR6 (Canadell et al., 2021) for a discussion on impacts of higher-emission and warming scenarios."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.3.5_p4,global warming ;methane;climate system;nitrous oxide,"Land ecosystems contribute substantially to global emissions of nitrous oxide and methane . As with CO2, these emissions respond both directly and indirectly to atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate change, and this gives rise to potential additional bio-geochemical feedbacks in the climate system. A large part of these emissions stem from land and water management, such as fertilizer application, rice production, aquaculture or animal husbandry (Jia et al., 2019). However, nearly 60% of total nitrous oxide emissions (in 2007–2016) has been estimated to stem from natural ecosystems, especially in the Tropics (Tian et al., 2019; Canadell et al., 2021), while freshwater wetlands and peatlands are estimated to contribute between 83% (top-down estimates) and 40% (bottom-up estimates) of total natural CH4 (and 31 and 20% of total methane emissions, respectively) for the period 2008–2017 (Canadell et al., 2021). Median CH4 emissions from northern-latitude wetlands in 2100 were estimated to be 12.1 and 13.5 PgC in emission scenarios leading to 1.5°C and 2°C warming, respectively (Comyn-Platt et al., 2018). Likewise, global warming has been attributed to soil N2O emission increases since the pre-industrial period of 0.8 (0.3–1.3) TgN yr -1 (Tian et al., 2020). Overall, climate feedbacks from future altered land ecosystem emissions of CH4 or N2O are uncertain, but are expected to be small (Canadell et al., 2021)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.3.5_p10,global warming ,"Global warming will strongly enhance freshwater CH4 emissions through a disproportionate increase in ebullition (gas flux) by 6–20% per 1°C increase in water temperature (Aben et al., 2017). It can be expected that ongoing eutrophication enhanced by climate change-related increases in the release of sediment nutrients and the loading of organic carbon and nutrients from catchments will enhance CH4 ebullition on a global scale (Aben et al., 2017; DelSontro et al., 2018; Bartosiewicz et al., 2019; Beaulieu et al., 2019; Sanches et al., 2019). The strongest increase in ebullition is expected in shallow waters where sediment temperatures are strongly related to atmospheric temperature (Aben et al., 2017). Given that small ponds and shallow lakes are the most abundant freshwater ecosystems globally, these may become hot spots of CH4 ebullition in the future (Aben et al., 2017). On average, CH4, CO2 and N2O account for 75, 23 and 2% of the total CO2-equivalent emissions, respectively, in lakes (DelSontro et al., 2018)."

Nevertheless, it is increasingly clear that EbA can offer a portfolio of effective measures to reduce the risks for people of climate change at the same time as benefitting biodiversity (robust evidence, high agreement ), providing that such measures are deployed with careful planning in a way that is appropriate for local ecological and societal contexts (robust evidence, high agreement ). This chapter has identified risks to species, communities, ecosystems and ecosystem services from climate change, all of which increase with each increment of Global Warming Level (2.5.1, 2.5.2, 2.5.3, 2.5.4). There is therefore a risk to Ecosystem-based Adaptation measures in some circumstances and this risk increases progressively above 1.5°C of warming."

However, agricultural expansion results in large conversions in tropical dry woodlands and savannahs in SA (Brazilian Cerrado, Caatinga and Chaco) (high confidence) (SRCCL Chapter 1, Arneth et al., 2019). The expansion of soybean plantations in the Amazonian state of Mato Grosso in Brazil reached 16.8% yr −1 from 2000 to 2005; and oil palm, a significant biofuel crop, is also linked to recent deforestation in tropical CA (Costa Rica and Honduras) and SA (Colombia and Ecuador), although lower in magnitude compared to deforestation from soybean and cattle ranching (WGII AR5 Chapter 27, Magrin et al., 2014)."

Indigenous and social movements have joined with climate justice activists, calling for action to address climate change (Hicks and Fabricant, 2016; Ruiz-Mallén et al., 2017; Charles, 2021). The Bolivian Platform against Climate Change, a coalition of civil society and social movement organisations working to address the effects of global warming in Bolivia and to influence the broader global community, reflects an innovative dimension that, though at times conflictual, has shown how increasing climate variability hinders the right of Indigenous Peoples to the conservation of their culture and practices and illustrates how grassroots movements are increasingly taking over climate-change policy in the region (Hicks and Fabricant, 2016). Social movements have engaged with international networks, such as Blokadia, which surged after COP 23, whose claims try to go beyond the protection of the environment and delve into issues of democracy and resource control (Martínez-Alier et al., 2018)."

This includes particularly the increasing body of literature since the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5) which focuses on net zero CO2 emissions pathways that avoid temperature overshoot and hence do not rely on net negative CO2 emissions. The chapter conducts a systematic assessment of the associated economic costs as well as the benefits of mitigation for other societal objectives, such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In addition, the chapter builds on SR1.5 and introduces a new conceptual framing for the assessment of possible social, economic, technical, political, and geophysical ‘feasibility’ concerns of alternative pathways, including the enabling conditions that would need to fall into place so that stringent climate goals become attainable."

The emulators are calibrated against the behaviour of complex climate models and observation data, consistent with the outcomes of AR6 WGI (Cross-Chapter Box 7.1). The climate assessment is a three-step process of harmonisation, infilling and a probabilistic climate model emulator run (Annex III.II.2.5). Warming projections until the year 2100 were derived for 1574 scenarios, of which 1202 passed vetting, with the remaining scenarios having insufficient information (Figure 3.3 and Table 3.1). For scenarios that limit warming to 2°C or lower, the SR1.5 classification was adopted in AR6, with more disaggregation provided for higher warming levels (Table 3.1). These choices can be compared with the selection of common global warming levels (GWLs) of 1.5°C, 2°C, 3°C and 4°C to classify climate change impacts in the WGII assessment."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.3.2.1_p1,global warming ,"Figure 3.10 shows the GHG and CO2 emission trajectories for different temperature categories as defined in Section 3.2 (the temperature levels are calculated using simple climate models, consistent with the outcomes of the recent WGI assessment, Cross-Chapter Box 7.1). It should be noted that most scenarios currently in the literature do not account for the impact of COVID-19 (Box 3.2). The higher categories (C6 and C7) mostly included scenarios with no or modest climate policy. Because of the progression of climate policy, it is becoming more common that reference scenarios incorporate implemented climate policies. Modelling studies typically implement current or pledged policies up until 2030 (Vrontisi et al. 2018; Roelfsema et al. 2020; Sognnaes et al. 2021) with some studies focusing also on the policy development in the long term (Höhne et al. 2021; IEA 2021 a; Jeffery et al. 2018; Gütschow et al. 2018). Based on the assessment in Chapter 4, reference pathways consistent with the implementation and trend from implemented policies until the end of 2020 are associated with increased GHG emissions from 59 (53–65) GtCO2-eq yr –1 in 2019 to 54–60 GtCO2-eq yr –1 by 2030 and to 47–67 GtCO2-eq yr –1 by 2050 (Figure 3.6). Pathways with these near-term emissions characteristics lead to a median global warming of 2.2°C to 3.5°C by 2100 (see also further in this section). These pathways consider policies at the time that they were developed. A recent model comparison that harmonised socio-economic, technological, and policy assumptions (Giarola et al. 2021) found a 2.2°C–2.9°C median temperature rise in 2100 for current and stated policies, with the results sensitive to the model used and the method of implementing policies (Sognnaes et al. 2021). Scenario inference and construction methods using similar policy assumptions lead to a median range of 2.9°C–3.2°C in 2100 for current policies and 2.4°C–2.9°C in 2100 for 2030 pledges (Höhne et al. 2021). The median spread of 1°C across these studies (2.2°C–3.2°C) indicates the deep uncertainties involved with modelling temperature outcomes of 2030 policies through to 2100 (Höhne et al. 2021)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.3.2.2_p5,global warming ;methane,"For accounting of emissions and the substitution of different gases as part of a mitigation strategy, typically, emission metrics are used to compare the climate impact of different gases. Most policies currently use Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) with a 100-year time horizon as this is also mandated for emissions reporting in the Paris Rulebook (for a wider discussion of GHG metrics, see Box 2.1 in Chapter 2 of this report, and AR6 WGI, Chapter 7, Section 7.6). Alternative metrics have also been proposed, such as those using a shorter or longer time horizon, or those that focus directly on the consequences of reaching a certain temperature target (Global Temperature Change Potential – GTP), allowing a more direct comparison with cumulative CO2 emissions (Allen et al. 2016; Lynch et al. 2020) or focusing on damages (Global Damage Potential) (an overview is given in Chapter 2, and Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 3). Depending on the metric, the value attributed to reducing short-lived forcers such as methane can be lower in the near term (e.g., in the case of GTP) or higher (GWP with a short reference period). For most metrics, however, the impact on mitigation strategies is relatively small, among others, due to the marginal abatement cost curve of methane (low costs for low-to-medium mitigation levels; expensive for high levels). The timing of reductions across different gases impacts warming and the co-benefits (Harmsen et al. 2016; Cain et al. 2019). Nearly all scenarios in the literature use GWP-100 in cost-optimisation, reflecting the existing policy approach; the use of GWP-100 deviates from cost-optimal mitigation pathways by at most a few percent for temperature goals that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower (Box 2.1)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#box-3.4_p16,global warming ;anthropogenic,"The concept of a finite carbon budget means that the world needs to get to net zero CO2, no matter whether global warming is limited to 1.5°C or well below 2°C (or any other level). Moreover, exceeding the remaining carbon budget will have consequences by overshooting temperature levels. Still, the relationship between the timing of net zero and temperature targets is a flexible one, as discussed further in Cross-Chapter Box 3 in this chapter. It should be noted that the national-level inventory as used by UNFCCC for the land use, land-use change and forestry sector is different from the overall concept of anthropogenic emissions employed by IPCC AR6 WGI. For emissions estimates based on these inventories, the remaining carbon budgets must be correspondingly reduced by approximately 15%, depending on the scenarios (Grassi et al., 2021) (Chapter 7)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#cross-chapter-box-3_p4,global warming ,"Reaching net zero CO2 emissions globally is necessary for limiting global warming to any level. At the point of net zero CO2, the amount of CO2 human activity is putting into the atmosphere equals the amount of CO2 human activity is removing from the atmosphere (see Annex I: Glossary). Reaching and sustaining net zero CO2 emissions globally stabilizes CO2-induced warming. Reaching net zero CO2 emissions and then moving to net negative CO2 emissions globally leads to a peak and decline in CO2-induced warming (AR6 WGI Sections 5.5 and 5.6)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#cross-chapter-box-3_p14,global warming ,"Reaching net zero GHG emissions globally in terms of GWP-100leads to a reduction in global warming from an earlier peak. This is due to net negative CO2 emissions balancing the GWP-100-equivalent emissions of short-lived GHG emissions, which by themselves do not contribute to further warming if sufficiently declining (Fuglestvedt et al. 2018; Rogelj et al. 2021). Hence, 1.5°C–2°C emissions pathways in the AR6 scenario database that reach global net zero GHG emissions in the second half of the century show warming being halted at some peak value followed by a gradual decline towards the end of the century (AR6 WGI Chapter 1, Box 1.4)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#cross-chapter-box-3_p22,global warming ,"Table 3.2 summarises the key characteristics for all temperature categories in terms of cumulative CO2 emissions, near-term emission reductions, and the years of peak emission and net zero CO2 and GHG emissions. The table shows again that many pathways in the literature limit global warming to 2°C (>67%) or limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot compared to pre-industrial levels. Cumulative net CO2 emissions from the year 2020 until the time of net zero CO2 in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot are 510 (330–710) GtCO2 and in pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%), 890 (640–1160) GtCO2 (see also Cross-Chapter Box 3 in this chapter). Mitigation pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) compared to pre-industrial levels are associated with net global GHG emissions of 44 (32–55) GtCO2-eq yr –1 by 2030 and 20 (13–26) GtCO2-eq yr –1 in 2050. These correspond to GHG emissions reductions of 21% (1–42%) by 2030, and 64% (53–77%) by 2050 relative to 2019 emission levels. Pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot require a further acceleration in the pace of the transformation, with GHG emissions reductions of 43% (34–60%) by 2030 and 84% (73–98%) in 2050 relative to modelled 2019 emission levels. The likelihood of limiting warming to below 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot of the most stringent mitigation pathways in the literature (C1) has declined since SR1.5. This is because emissions have risen since 2010 by about 9 GtCO2 yr –1, resulting in relatively higher near-term emissions of the AR6 pathways by 2030 and slightly later dates for reaching net zero CO2 emissions compared to SR1.5."

For emissions-related columns these values relate to the distribution of all the pathways in that category. Harmonised emissions values are given for consistency with projected global warming outcomes using climate emulators. Based on the assessment of climate emulators in AR6 WGI (WG1 Chapter 7, Box 7.1), two climate emulators are used for the probabilistic assessment of the resulting warming of the pathways. For the ‘Temperature change’ and ‘Likelihood’ columns, the single upper-row values represent the 50th percentile across the pathways in that category and the median [50th percentile] across the warming estimates of the probabilistic MAGICC climate model emulator. For the bracketed ranges, the median warming for every pathway in that category is calculated for each of the two climate model emulators (MAGICC and FaIR). Subsequently, the 5th and 95th percentile values across all pathways for each emulator are calculated. The coolest and warmest outcomes (i.e., the lowest p5 of two emulators, and the highest p95, respectively) are shown in square brackets. These ranges therefore cover both the uncertainty of the emissions pathways as well as the climate emulators’ uncertainty."

cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.5.2_p2,global warming ,"Without a strengthening of policies beyond those that are implemented by the end of 2020, GHG emissions are projected to rise beyond 2025, leading to a median global warming of 3.2 [2.2 to 3.5] °C by 2100. Modelled pathways that are consistent with NDCs announced prior to COP26 until 2030 and assume no increase in ambition thereafter have lower emissions, leading to a median global warming of 2.8°C [2.1–3.4°C] by 2100."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.5.2_p4,global warming ,"The challenges are illustrated in Table 3.6 and Figure 3.30, surveying global mitigation pathways in the literature that were collected in the AR6 scenarios database. There is a clear trend of increasing peak warming with increasing 2030 GHG emission levels (Figure 3.30a,b). In particular, there is no mitigation pathway designed to follow the NDCs until 2030 that can limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot. Our assessment confirms the finding of the IPCCSpecial Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (Rogelj et al. 2018) for the case of NDCs announced prior to COP26 that pathways following the NDCs until 2030 ‘would not limit global warming to 1.5°C, even if supplemented by very challenging increases in the scale and ambition of emissions reductions after 2030’ (SR1.5 SPM). This assessment is now more robust than in SR1.5 as it is based on a larger set of 1.5°C–2°C pathways with better representation of current trends and plans covering a wider range of post-2030 emissions developments. In particular, a recent multi-model study limiting peak cumulative CO2 emissions for a wide range of carbon budgets and immediate vs NDC-type action until 2030 established a feasibility frontier for the existence of such pathways across participating models (Riahi et al. 2021)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.5.2.2_p2,global warming ;fossil fuel,"A systematic map of the literature on carbon lock-in has synthesized quantification of stranded assets in the mitigation pathways literature, and showed that (i) coal power plants are the most exposed to risk of becoming stranded, (ii) delayed mitigation action increases stranded assets, and (iii) sectoral distribution and the amount of stranded assets differ between countries (Fisch-Romito et al. 2021). There is high agreement that existing fossil fuel infrastructure would need to be retired earlier than historically, used less, or retrofitted with CCS, to stay within the remaining carbon budgets of limiting warming to 1.5°C or 2°C (Johnson et al. 2016; Kefford et al. 2018; Pfeiffer et al. 2018; Cui et al. 2019; Fofrich et al. 2020; Rogelj et al. 2018 a). Studies estimate that cumulative early retired power plant capacities by 2060 can be up to 600 GW for gas and 1700 GW for coal (Iyer et al. 2015a; Kefford et al. 2018), that only 42% of the total capital stock of both operating and planned coal-fired powers plants can be utilised to be compatible with the 2°C target (Pfeiffer et al. 2018), and that coal-fired power plants in scenarios consistent with keeping global warming below 2°C or 1.5°C retire one to three decades earlier than historically has been the case (Cui et al. 2019; Fofrich et al. 2020). After coal, electricity production based on gas is also projected to be phased out, with some capacity remaining as back-up (van Soest et al. 2017a). Kefford et al. (2018) find USD541 billion worth of stranded fossil fuel power plants could be created by 2060, with China and India the most exposed."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.5.3_p2,global warming ,"The large literature on accelerating climate action was assessed in the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (de Coninck et al. 2018) and is taken up in this report primarily in Chapters 4, 13, and 14. Accelerating climate action and facilitating transformational change requires a perspective on socio-technical transitions (Geels et al. 2016a; Geels et al. 2016b; Geels 2020), a portfolio of policy instruments to manage technological and environmental change (Fischer and Newell 2008; Goulder and Parry 2008; Acemoglu et al. 2012, 2016), a notion of path dependency and policy sequencing (Pierson 2000; Meckling et al. 2017; Pahle et al. 2018) and the evolvement of polycentric governance layers of institutions and norms in support of the transformation (Dietz et al. 2003; Leach et al. 2007; Messner 2015). This subsection is focused on an assessment of the emerging quantitative literature on global accelerated action pathways towards 1.5°C–2°C, which to a large extent abstracts from the underlying processes and uses a number of stylised approaches to generate these pathways. A representative of accelerated action pathways has been identified as one of the Illustrative Mitigation Pathways (IMPs) in this assessment (IMP-GS, Figure 3.31)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#box-3.5_p2,global warming ,"The marginal abatement cost of carbon, also called carbon price, is determined by the mitigation target under consideration: it describes the cost of reducing the last unit of emissions to reach the target at a given point in time. Total macroeconomic mitigation costs (or gains) aggregate the economy-wide impacts of investments in low-carbon solutions and structural changes away from emitting activities. The total macroeconomic effects of mitigation pathways are reported in terms of variations in economic output or consumption levels, measured against a reference scenario, also called baseline, at various points in time or discounted over a given time period. Depending on the study, the reference scenario reflects specific assumptions about patterns of socio-economic development and assumes either no-climate policies or the climate policies in place or planned at the time the study was carried out. When available in the AR6 scenarios database, this second type of reference scenario, with trends from implemented policies until the end of 2020, has been chosen for computation of mitigation costs. In the vast majority of studies that have produced the body of work on the cost of mitigation assessed here, and in particular in all studies that have submitted global scenarios to the AR6 scenarios database except (Schultes et al. 2021), the feedbacks of climate change impacts on the economic development pathways are not accounted for. This omission of climate impacts leads to overly optimistic economic projections in the reference scenarios, in particular in reference scenarios with no or limited mitigation action where the extent of global warming is the greatest. Mitigation cost estimates computed against no or limited policy reference scenarios therefore omit economic benefits brought by avoided climate change impact along mitigation pathways, and should be interpreted with care (Grant et al. 2020). When aggregate economic benefits from avoided climate change impacts are accounted for, mitigation is a welfare-enhancing strategy (Section 3.6.2)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#cross-working-group-box-1_p2,global warming ;adaptation;climate system;weather,"Mitigation reduces the extent of climate change and its impacts on ecosystems, infrastructure, and livelihoods. This box summarises elements from the AR6 WGII report on aggregate climate change impacts and risks, putting them into the context of mitigation pathways. AR6 WGII provides an assessment of current lines of evidence regarding potential climate risks with future climate change, and therefore, the avoided risks from mitigating climate change. Regional and sectoral climate risks to physical and social systems are assessed (AR6 WGII Chapters 2–15). Over 100 of these are identified as Key Risks (KRs) and further synthesised by WGII Chapter 16 into eight overarching Representative Key Risks (RKRs) relating to low-lying coastal systems; terrestrial and ocean ecosystems; critical physical infrastructure, networks and services; living standards; human health; food security; water security; and peace and mobility (AR6 WGII Section 16.5.2). The RKR assessment finds that risks increase with global warming level, and also depend on socio-economic development conditions, which shape exposure and vulnerability, and adaptation opportunities and responses. ‘Reasons For Concern’, another WGII aggregate climate-impacts risk framing, are also assessed to increase with climate change, with increasing risk for unique and threatened systems, extreme weather events, distribution of impacts, global aggregate impacts, and large-scale singular events (AR6 WGII Chapter 16). For human systems, in general, the poor and disadvantaged are found to have greater exposure level and vulnerability for a given hazard. With some increase in global average warming from today expected regardless of mitigation efforts, human and natural systems will be exposed to new conditions and additional adaptation will be needed (AR6 WGII Chapter 18). The range of dates for when a specific warming level could be reached depends on future global emissions, with significant overlap of ranges across emissions scenarios due to climate system response uncertainties (AR6 WGI Tables 4.2 and 4.5). The speed at which the climate changes is relevant to adaptation timing, possibilities, and net impacts."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#FAQ 3.2_p1,global warming ;greenhouse gas;global warming potential,"Halting global warming in the long term requires, at a minimum, that no additional CO2 emissions from human activities are added to the atmosphere (i.e., CO2 emissions must reach ‘net’ zero). Given that CO2 emissions constitute the dominant human influence on global climate, global net zero CO2 emissions are a prerequisite for stabilising warming at any level. However, CO2 is not the only greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming and reducing emissions of other greenhouse gases (GHGs) alongside CO2 towards net zero emissions of all GHGs would lower the level at which global temperature would peak. The temperature implications of net zero GHG emissions depend on the bundle of gases that is being considered, and the emissions metric used to calculate aggregated GHG emissions and removals. If reached and sustained, global net zero GHG emissions using the 100-year Global Warming Potential (GWP-100) will lead to gradually declining global temperature."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#executive-summary_p6,global warming ,"The global share of future urban GHG emissions is expected to increase through 2050, with moderate to low mitigation efforts, due to growth trends in population, urban land expansion, and infrastructure and service demands, but the extent of the increase depends on the scenario and the scale and timing of urban mitigation action (medium confidence). In modelled scenarios, global consumption-based urban CO2 and CH4 emissions are projected to rise from 29 GtCO2-eq in 2020 to 34 GtCO2-eq in 2050 with moderate mitigation efforts (intermediate GHG emissions, SSP2–4.5), and up to 40 GtCO2-eq in 2050 with low mitigation efforts (high GHG emissions, SSP3–7.0). With aggressive and immediate mitigation policies to limit global warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot by the end of the century (very low emissions, SSP1–1.9), including high levels of electrification, energy and material efficiency, renewable energy preferences, and socio-behavioural responses, urban GHG emissions could approach net-zero and reach a maximum of 3 GtCO2-eq in 2050. Under a scenario with aggressive but not immediate urban mitigation policies to limit global warming to 2°C (>67%) (low emissions, SSP1–2.6), urban emissions could reach 17 GtCO2-eq in 2050. 2  (Figure TS.13) {8.3.4}"
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.1.1_p4,global warming ,"Cities are also gaining traction within the work of the IPCC. The IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5 Chapter 4) identified four systems that urgently need to change in fundamental and transformative ways: urban infrastructure, land use and ecosystems, industry, and energy. Urban infrastructure was singled out but urban systems form a pivotal part of the other three systems requiring change (IPCC 2018a) (see ‘infrastructure’ in Glossary). The IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL) identified cities not only as spatial units for land-based mitigation options but also places for managing demand for natural resources including food, fibre, and water (IPCC 2019)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#cross-working-group-box-2:-cities-and-climate-change_p10,global warming ;adaptation,"The benefits of actions taken to reduce GHG emissions and climate stressors diminish with delayed action, indicating the necessity for rapid responses. Delaying the same actions for increasing the resilience of infrastructure from 2020 to 2030 is estimated to have a median cost of at least USD1 trillion (Hallegatte et al. 2019) while also missing the carbon emissions reductions required in the narrowing window of opportunity to limit global warming to 1.5°C (WGI). In contrast, taking integrated actions towards mitigation, adaptation, and sustainable development will provide multiple benefits for the health and well-being of urban inhabitants and avoid stranded assets (see WGII Section 6.3, WGII Chapter 17, Cross-Chapter Box on ‘Feasibility’ in WGII Chapter 18, WGIII Chapter 5, and WGIII Section 8.2)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.3.4.2_p10,global warming ,"In 2020, total urban emissions (including CO2 and CH4) derived from consumption-based accounting were estimated to be 29 GtCO2-eq, representing between 67% and 72% of global CO2 and CH4 emissions, excluding aviation, shipping, and biogenic sources of emissions. By 2050, with moderate to low urban mitigation efforts, urban emissions are projected to rise to 34.0 GtCO2-eq (SSP2-RCP4.5) or 40.2 GtCO2-eq (SSP3-RCP7.0) – driven by growing urban population, infrastructure, and service demands. However, scenarios that involve rapid urbanisation can have different outcomes as seen in SSP1-RCP1.9 based on green growth, versus SSP5-RCP8.5 with the strongest carbon lock-in lacking any decarbonisation. Other scenarios involve mixed and/or low urbanisation, along with other differences, including the implementation of electrification, energy, and material efficiency, technology development and innovation, renewable energy preferences, and behavioural, lifestyle, and dietary responses (Table 8.2). With aggressive and immediate mitigation efforts to limit global warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot, urban GHG emissions could approach net-zero and reach a maximum of 3.3 GtCO2-eq in 2050 (SSP1-RCP1.9). Under aggressive but not immediate urban mitigation efforts to limit global warming to 2°C (>67%), urban emissions could reach 17.2 GtCO2-eq in 2050 (SSP1-RCP2.6)."

cleaned_content/wg1/Chapter03#3.3.2.1_p2,greenhouse gas,"Records of tree ring width have provided evidence that recent prolonged dry spells in the Levant and Chile are unprecedented in the last millennium (high confidence) (Cook et al., 2016a; Garreaud et al., 2017). East Africa has also been drying in recent decades (Rowell et al., 2015; Hoell et al., 2017), a trend that is unusual in the context of the sedimentary paleorecord spanning the last millennium (Tierney et al., 2015). This may be a signature of anthropogenic forcing but cannot yet be distinguished from natural variability (Hoell et al., 2017; Philip et al., 2018). Likewise, tree rings indicate that the 2012–2014 drought in the south-western United States was exceptionally severe in the context of natural variability over the last millennium, and may have been exacerbated by the contribution of anthropogenic temperature rise (medium confidence) (Griffin and Anchukaitis, 2014; Williams et al., 2015). Furthermore, Williams et al. (2020) used a combination of hydrological modelling and tree-ring reconstructions to show that the period from 2000 to 2018 was the driest 19-year span in south-western North America since the late 1500s. Nonetheless, tree rings also indicate the presence of prolonged megadroughts in western North America throughout the last millennium that were more severe than 20th and 21st century events (high confidence) (Cook et al., 2004, 2010, 2015). These were associated with internal variability (Coats et al., 2016; Cook et al., 2016b) and indicate that large-magnitude changes in the water cycle may occur irrespective of anthropogenic influence (see also McKitrick and Christy, 2019)."
cleaned_content/wg1/Chapter03#3.3.2.3_p1,greenhouse gas;anthropogenic,"AR5 concluded that there was medium confidence that human influence had contributed to large-scale precipitation changes over land since 1950, including an increase in the Northern Hemisphere mid- to high latitudes. Moreover, AR5 concluded that observational uncertainties and challenges in precipitation modelling precluded a more confident assessment (Bindoff et al., 2013). Overall, it found that large-scale features of mean precipitation in CMIP5 models were in modest agreement with observations, but there were systematic errors in the tropics (Flato et al., 2013)."

cleaned_content/syr/longer-report#2.1_p1,greenhouse gas;weather,"Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to increase over 2010–2019, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production across regions, between and within countries, and between individuals (high confidence). Human-caused climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related losses and damages 63  to nature and people (high confidence). Vulnerable communities who have historically contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected (high confidence)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#FAQ 2.5_p7,greenhouse gas,"While NbS help us to adapt to climate change and reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, it is important to note that there are limits to what they can do. To provide a safe environment for both people and nature, it will be essential to radically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, especially those from fossil-fuel burning in the near future."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.1.1_p2,greenhouse gas;Deforestation,"Land use changes in the region, particularly deforestation, are significant, mostly due to agricultural production for export purposes, one of the main sources of income for the area (Salazar et al., 2016) (Figure 12.2c). Additional pressure on the land comes from illegal activities, pollution and induced fires. These changes exacerbate the impacts of climate change and make the region a key player in the future of the world economy and food production (IPBES, 2018a). The region boasts the largest tropical forest on the planet and other important biomes of high biodiversity on mountains, lowlands and coastal areas. It can potentially continue its agricultural expansion and development at the expense of substantially reducing the areas of natural biomes. Indigenous Peoples and smallholder families are lacking adequate climate policies combined with institutions to protect their property rights; this could result in a more sustainable process of agricultural expansion, without substantially increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the vulnerability of those populations (high confidence) (Sá et al., 2017)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.1.1_p1,greenhouse gas;climate change mitigation,"Chapter 3 takes a long-term perspective on climate change mitigation pathways. Its focus is on the implications of long-term targets for the required short- and medium-term system changes and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This focus dictates a more global view and on issues related to path-dependency and up-scaling of mitigation options necessary to achieve different emissions trajectories, including particularly deep mitigation pathways that require rapid and fundamental changes."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.3.1_p1,greenhouse gas,"Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions mainly originate from the use and transformation of energy, agriculture, land use (change) and industrial activities. The future development of these sources is influenced by trends in socio-economic development, including population, economic activity, technology, politics, lifestyles, and climate policy. Trends for these factors are not independent, and scenarios provide a consistent outlook for these factors together (Section 3.2). Marangoni et al. (2017) show that in projections, assumptions influencing energy intensity (e.g., structural change, lifestyle and efficiency) and economic growth are the most important determinants of future CO2 emissions from energy combustion. Other critical factors include technology assumptions, preferences, resource assumptions and policy (van Vuuren et al. 2008). As many of the factors are represented differently in specific models, the model itself is also an important factor – providing a reason for the importance of model diversity (Sognnaes et al. 2021). For land use, Stehfest et al. (2019) show that assumptions on population growth are more dominant given that variations in per capita consumption of food are smaller than for energy. Here, we only provide a brief overview of some key drivers. We focus first on so-called reference scenarios (without stringent climate policy) and look at mitigation scenarios in detail later. We use the SSPs to discuss trends in more detail. The SSPs were published in 2017, and by now, some elements will have to be updated (O’Neill et al. 2020b). Still, the ranges represent the full literature relatively well."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.3.2.1_p2,greenhouse gas,"The lower categories include increasingly stringent assumed climate policies. For all scenario categories, except the highest category, emissions peak in the 21st century. For the lowest categories, the emissions peak is mostly before 2030. In fact, for scenarios in the category that avoids temperature overshoot for the 1.5°C scenario (C1 category), GHG emissions are reduced already to almost zero around the middle of the century. Typically, CO2 emissions reach net zero about 10 to 40 years before total GHG emissions reach net zero. The main reason is that scenarios reduce non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions less than CO2 due to a limited mitigation potential (Section 3.3.2.2). Figure 3.10 also shows that many scenarios in the literature with a temperature outcome below 2°C show net negative emissions. There are, however, also exceptions in which more immediate emission reductions limits the need for CDR. The IMPs illustrate alternative pathways to reach the C1–C3 temperature levels."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.3.2.3_p1,greenhouse gas;anthropogenic,"In addition to the constraints on change in global mean temperature, the Paris Agreement also calls for reaching a balance of sources and sinks of GHG emissions (Art. 4). Different interpretations of the concept related to balance have been published (Rogelj et al. 2015c; Fuglestvedt et al. 2018). Key concepts include that of net zero CO2 emissions (anthropogenic CO2 sources and sinks equal zero) and net zero greenhouse gas emissions (see Annex I: Glossary, and Box 3.3). The same notion can be used for all GHG emissions, but here ranges also depend on the use of equivalence metrics (Box 2.1). Moreover, it should be noted that while reaching net zero CO2 emissions typically coincides with the peak in temperature increase; net zero GHG emissions (based on GWP-100) imply a decrease in global temperature (Riahi et al. 2021) and net zero GHG emissions typically require negative CO2 emissions to compensate for the remaining emissions from other GHGs. Many countries have started to formulate climate policy in the year that net zero emissions (either CO2 or all greenhouse gases) are reached – although, at the moment, formulations are often still vague (Rogelj et al. 2021). There has been increased attention on the timing of net zero emissions in the scientific literature and ways to achieve it."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#box-3.2_p1,greenhouse gas,"The reduction in CO2 emissions of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 was estimated to be about 6% (Section 4.2.2.4 and Table 4.SM.2) lower than 2019 levels (Forster et al. 2020; Friedlingstein et al. 2020; Liu et al. 2020c; BP 2021; Crippa et al. 2021; IEA 2021; Le Quéré et al. 2021). Near-real-time monitoring estimates show a rebound in emissions levels, meaning 2021 emissions levels are expected to be higher than 2020 (Le Quéré et al. 2021). The longer-term effects are uncertain but so far do not indicate a clear structural change for climate policy related to the pandemic. The increase in renewable shares in 2020 could stimulate a further transition, but slow economic growth can also slow down (renewable) energy investments. Also, lifestyle changes during the crisis can still develop in different directions (working from home, but maybe also living further away from work). Without a major intervention, most long-term scenarios project that emissions will start to follow a similar pathway as earlier projections (although at a reduced level) (IEA 2020b; Kikstra et al. 2021a; Rochedo et al. 2021). If emissions reductions are limited to only a short time, the adjustment of pathways will lead to negligible outcomes in the order of 0.01K (Forster et al. 2020; Jones et al. 2021). At the same time, however, the large amount of investments pledged in the recovery packages could provide a unique opportunity to determine the long-term development of infrastructure, energy systems and land use (Andrijevic et al. 2020b; Hepburn et al. 2020; Pianta et al. 2021). Near-term alternative recovery pathways have been shown to have the potential to influence carbon-price pathways, and energy investments and electrification requirements under stringent mitigation targets (Bertram et al. 2021; Kikstra et al. 2021a; Pollitt et al. 2021; Rochedo et al. 2021; Shan et al. 202). Most studies suggest a noticeable reduction in 2030 emissions. However, much further reductions would be needed to reach the emission levels consistent with mitigation scenarios that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower (see Chapter 4). At the moment, the share of investments in greenhouse gas reduction is relatively small in most recovery packages, and no structural shifts for climate policies are observed linked to the pandemic. Finally, most of the scenarios analysed in this Chapter do not include the 2020 emissions reduction related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The effect of the pandemic on the pathways will likely be very small. The assessment of climate mitigation pathways in this chapter should be interpreted as being almost exclusively based on the assumption of a fast recovery with limited persistent effects on emissions or structural changes."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#FAQ 3.3_p1,greenhouse gas;climate sensitivity,"IAMs are used to develop a wide range of scenarios describing future trajectories for greenhouse gas emissions based on a wide set of assumptions regarding socio-economic development, technological changes, political development and climate policy. Typically, the IAM-based scenarios can be divided into (i) reference scenarios (describing possible trajectories in the absence of new stringent climate policies) and (ii) mitigation scenarios (describing the impact of various climate policy assumptions). Reference scenarios typically result in high emissions and, subsequently, high levels of climate change (in the order of 2.5°C–4°C during the 21st century). The purpose of such reference scenarios is to explore the consequences of climate change and act as a reference for mitigation scenarios. The possible emission levels for reference scenarios diverge from stabilising and even slowly declining emissions (e.g., for current policy scenarios or SSP1) to very high emission levels (e.g., SSP5 and RCP8.5). The latter leads to nearly 5°C of warming by the end of the century for medium climate sensitivity. Hausfather and Peters (2020) pointed out that since 2011, the rapid development of renewable energy technologies and emerging climate policy have made it considerably less likely that emissions could end up as high as RCP8.5. This means that reaching emissions levels as high as RCP8.5 has become less likely . Still, high emissions cannot be ruled out for many reasons, including political factors and, for instance, higher than anticipated population and economic growth. Climate projections of RCP8.5 can also result from strong feedbacks of climate change on (natural) emission sources and high climate sensitivity (AR6 WGI Chapter 7). Therefore, their median climate impacts might also materialise while following a lower emission path (e.g., Hausfather and Betts 2020). All in all, this means that high-end scenarios have become considerably less likely since AR5 but cannot be ruled out. High-end scenarios (like RCP8.5) can be very useful to explore high-end risks of climate change but are not typical ‘business-as-usual’ projections and should therefore not be presented as such."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#executive-summary_p2,greenhouse gas,"Most future urban population growth will occur in developing countries, where per capita emissions are currently low but expected to increase with the construction and use of new infrastructure and the built environment, and changes in incomes and lifestyles (very high confidence). The drivers of urban greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are complex and include an interplay of population size, income, state of urbanisation, and how cities are laid out (i.e. urban form). How new cities and towns are designed, constructed, managed, and powered will lock-in behaviour, lifestyles, and future urban GHG emissions. Low-emission urbanisation can improve well-being while minimising impact on GHG emissions, but there is risk that urbanisation can lead to increased global GHG emissions through increased emissions outside the city’s boundaries. {8.1.4, 8.3, Box 8.1, 8.4, 8.6}"
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.1.1_p1,greenhouse gas,The Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was the first IPCC report that had a standalone chapter on urban mitigation of climate change. The starting point for that chapter was how the spatial organisation of urban settlements affects greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and how urban form and infrastructure could facilitate mitigation of climate change. A main finding in AR5 was that urban form shapes urban energy consumption and GHG emissions.

cleaned_content/wg1/Chapter03#3.3.2.2_p4,fossil fuel;methane;ozone,"The detection and attribution of tropospheric water vapour changes can be traced back to Santer et al. (2007), who used estimates of atmospheric water vapour from the satellite-based Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) and from CMIP3 historical climate simulations. They provided evidence of human-induced moistening of the troposphere, and found that the simulated human fingerprint pattern was detectable at the 5% level by 2002 in water vapour satellite data (from 1988 to 2006). The observed changes matched the historical simulations forced by greenhouse gas changes and other anthropogenic forcings, and not those due to natural variability alone. Then, Santer et al. (2009) repeated this study with CMIP5 models, and found that the detection and attribution conclusions were not sensitive to model quality. These results demonstrate that the human fingerprint is governed by robust and basic physical processes, such as the water vapour feedback. Finally, Chung et al. (2014) extended this line of research by focusing on the global-mean water vapour content in the upper troposphere. Using satellite-based observations and sets of CMIP5 climate simulations run under various climate-forcing options, they showed that the observed moistening trend of the upper troposphere over the 1979–2005 period could not be explained by internal variability alone, but is attributable to a combination of anthropogenic and natural forcings. This increase in water vapour is accompanied by a reduction in mid-tropospheric relative humidity and clouds in the subtropics and mid-latitude in both models and observations related to changes in the Hadley cell (Section 3.3.3.1.1; Lau and Kim, 2015)."
cleaned_content/wg1/Chapter03#3.3.2.4_p3,fossil fuel,"Recently, Gudmundsson et al. (2021) performed a global detection and attribution study on streamflow and found that some regions are drying and others are wetting. Moreover, the simulated streamflow trends are consistent with observations only if externally forced climate change is considered, and the simulated effects of water and land management cannot reproduce the observed trends. The effects of volcanic eruptions in driving reduced streamflow have also been detected in the wet tropics (Iles and Hegerl, 2015; Zuo et al., 2019)."
cleaned_content/wg1/Chapter03#3.4.2_p1,fossil fuel,"Seasonal snow cover is a defining climate feature of the northern continents. It is therefore of considerable interest that climate models correctly simulate this feature. It is discussed in more detail in Section 9.5.3, and observational aspects of snow cover are assessed in Section 2.3.2.2."
cleaned_content/wg1/Chapter03#3.4.2_p2,fossil fuel;Biomass,"The AR5 noted the strong linear correlation between Northern Hemisphere snow cover extent (SCE) and annual-mean surface air temperature in CMIP5 models. It was assessed as likely  that there had been an anthropogenic contribution to observed reductions in Northern Hemisphere snow cover since 1970 (Bindoff et al., 2013). The AR5 assessed that CMIP5 models reproduced key features of observed snow cover well, including the seasonal cycle of snow cover over northern regions of Eurasia and North America, but had more difficulties in more southern regions with intermittent snow cover. The AR5 also found that CMIP5 models underestimated the observed reduction in spring snow cover over this period (Figure 3.22; see also Brutel-Vuilmet et al., 2013; Thackeray et al., 2016; Santolaria-Otín and Zolina, 2020). This behaviour has been linked to how the snow-albedo feedback is represented in models (Thackeray et al., 2018a). The CMIP5 multi-model ensemble has been shown to represent the snow-albedo feedback more realistically than CMIP3, although models from some individual modelling centres have not improved or have even got worse (Thackeray et al., 2018a). There is still a systematic overestimation of the albedo of boreal forest covered by snow (Thackeray et al., 2015; Y. Li et al., 2016). Consequently, the snow albedo feedback might have been overestimated by CMIP5 models (Section 9.5.3; Xiao et al., 2017)."
cleaned_content/wg1/Chapter03#3.5_p2,fossil fuel,"Ocean model development has advanced considerably since AR5 (Section 1.5.3.1). Ongoing model developments since AR5 have focused on improving the realism of the simulated ocean in coupled models, with horizontal resolutions increasing to 10–100 km (from about 200 km in CMIP5), and increased vertical resolutions in many modelling systems of 0–1 m for near-surface levels (from the highest resolution of 10 m in CMIP5). These developments are aimed at improving the representation of the diurnal cycle and coupling to the atmosphere (e.g., Bernie et al., 2005, 2007, 2008). General improvements to simulated ocean fidelity in response to increasing resolution are expected (Hewitt et al., 2017), and the effects of model resolution on the fidelity of ocean models are discussed in more detail in Sections 9.2.2 and 9.2.4."

Zoonoses comprise nearly two-thirds of known human infectious diseases and the majority of newly emerging ones. COVID-19 is the most recent zoonosis and has killed millions of people globally while devastating economies. The risk posed by Emerging Infectious Diseases (EIDs) has increased because of: (1) the movement of wild animals and their parasites into new areas as a result of climate change, global trade and travel; (2) human intrusion in natural areas and the conversion of natural areas for agriculture, livestock, the extraction of industrial/raw materials and housing; (3) increased wildlife trade and consumption; (4) increased human mobility resulting from global trade, war/conflicts and migration, made faster and extending farther due to fossil fuel-powered travel; and (5) widespread antimicrobial use, which can promote antibiotic-resistant infections (Figure FAQ2.2.1)."

cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.3.2.2_p3,fossil fuel,"CH4 and N2O emissions are also reduced from C7 to C1, but this mostly occurs between C7 and C5. The main reason is the characteristics of abatement potential: technical measures can significantly reduce CH4 and N2O emissions at relatively low costs to about 50% of the current levels (e.g., by reducing CH4 leaks from fossil fuel production and transport, reducing landfill emissions gazing, land management and introducing measures related to manure management, see also Chapter 7 and 11). However, technical potential estimates become exhausted even if the stringency of mitigation is increased (Harmsen et al. 2019a,b; Höglund-Isaksson et al. 2020). Therefore, further reduction may come from changes in activity levels, such as switching to a less meat-intensive diet, therefore reducing livestock (Stehfest et al. 2009; Willett et al. 2019; Ivanova et al. 2020) (Chapter 7). Other non-CO2GHG emissions (halogenated gases) are reduced to low levels for scenarios below 2.5°C."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.3.2.2_p4,fossil fuel;methane;ozone,"Short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs) also play an important role in climate change, certainly for short-term changes (AR6 WGI, Figure SPM.2) (Shindell et al. 2012). These forcers consist of (i) substances contributing to warming, such as methane, black carbon and tropospheric ozone, and (ii) substances contributing to cooling (other aerosols, such as related to sulphur emissions). Most SLCFs are also air pollutants, and reducing their emissions provides additional co-benefits (Shindell et al. 2017a,b; Hanaoka and Masui 2020). In the case of the first group, emission reduction thus leads to both air pollution and climate benefits. For the second, group there is a possible trade-off (Shindell and Smith 2019; Lund et al. 2020). As aerosol emissions are mostly associated with fossil fuel combustion, the benefits of reducing CO2 could, in the short term, be reduced as a result of lower aerosol cooling. There has been an active discussion on the exact climate contribution of SLCF-focused policies in the literature. This discussion partly emerged from different assumptions on possible reductions in the absence of ambitious climate policy and the uncertain global climate benefit from aerosol (black carbon) (Rogelj et al. 2014). The latter is now assessed to be smaller than originally thought (Takemura and Suzuki 2019; Smith et al. 2020b) (see also AR6 WGI Section 6.4). Reducing SLCF emissions is critical to meet long-term climate goals and might help reduce the rate of climate change in the short term. Deep SLCF emission reductions also increase the remaining carbon budget for a specific temperature goal (Rogelj et al. 2015a; Reisinger et al. 2021) (Box 3.4). A more detailed discussion can be found in AR6 WGI Chapters 5 and 6."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.3.2.4_p3,fossil fuel,"The spread shown in Figure 3.15 implies different mitigation strategies that could all lead to emissions levels consistent with the Paris Agreement (and reach zero emissions). The IMPs illustrate some options for different decarbonisation pathways with heavy reliance on renewables (IMP-Ren), strong emphasis on energy-demand reductions (IMP-LD), widespread deployment of CDR methods coupled with CCS (BECCS and DACCS) (IMP-Neg), mitigation in the context of sustainable development (IMP-SP) (Figure 3.16). For example, in some scenarios, a small part of the energy system is still based on fossil fuels in 2100 (IMP-Neg), while in others, fossil fuels are almost or completely phased out (IMP-Ren). Nevertheless, in all scenarios, fossil fuel use is greatly reduced and unabated coal use is completely phased out by 2050. Also, nuclear power can be part of a mitigation strategy (however, the literature only includes some scenarios with high-nuclear contributions, such as Berger et al. 2017). This is explored further in Section 3.5. The different strategies are also clearly apparent in the way they scenarios reach net zero emissions. While IMP-GS and IMP-Neg rely significantly on BECCS and DACCS, their use is far more restricted in the other IMPs. Consistently, in these IMPs residual emissions are also significantly lower."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.4.2_p1,fossil fuel,"Without mitigation, energy consumption and supply emissions continue to rise ( high confidence) (Kriegler et al. 2016; Bauer et al. 2017; Riahi et al. 2017; Mcjeon et al. 2021) (Section 6.7). While the share of renewable energy continues to grow in reference scenarios, fossil fuel accounts for the largest share of primary energy (Bauer et al. 2017; Price and Keppo 2017; Riahi et al. 2017). In scenarios that limit warming to 2°C or lower, transition of the energy-supply sector to a low- or no-carbon system is rapid (Rogelj et al. 2016, 2018b; Grubler et al. 2018; Luderer et al. 2018; van Vuuren et al. 2018). CO2 emissions from energy supply reach net zero around 2041 (2033–2057) in pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot and around 2053 (2040–2066) in pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%).

In these pathways, the use of coal, gas and oil is reduced by 90%, 25%, and 41%, respectively, between 2019 and 2050 and 91%, 39%, and 78% between 2019 and 2100; coal without CCS is further reduced to 99% below its 2019 levels in 2100. These pathways show an increase in low-carbon energy, with 88% (69–97%) of primary energy from low-carbon sources in 2100, with different combinations of low-carbon fuels (e.g., non-biomass renewables, biomass, nuclear, and CCS) (Rogelj et al. 2018 a,b; van Vuuren et al. 2018) (Sections 3.4.1 and 6.7). Across all pathways that limit warming to 2°C and below, non-biomass renewables account for 52% (24–77%) of primary energy in 2100 (Creutzig et al. 2017; Pietzcker et al. 2017; Rogelj et al. 2018 b) (Chapter 6 and Figure 3.22). There are some studies analysing the potential for 100% renewable energy systems (Hansen et al. 2019); however, there are a range of issues around such systems (Box 6.6)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.5_p2,fossil fuel,"The assessment in this section shows that if mitigation ambitions in NDCs announced prior to COP262, 18  are followed until 2030, leading to estimated emissions of 47–57 GtCO2-eq in 203019  (Section 4.2.2), it is no longer possible to limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot ( high confidence). Instead, it would entail high overshoot (typically >0.1°C) and reliance on net negative CO2 emissions with uncertain potential to return warming to 1.5°C (>50%) by the end of the century. It would also strongly increase mitigation challenges to limit warming to 2°C (>67%) ( high confidence). GHG emissions reductions would need to abruptly increase after 2030 to an annual average rate of 1.4–2.0 GtCO2-eq during the period 2030–2050, around 70% higher than in mitigation pathways assuming immediate action 1 to limit warming to 2°C (>67%). The higher post-2030 reduction rates would have to be obtained in an environment of continued buildup of fossil fuel infrastructure and less development of low-carbon alternatives until 2030. A lock-in to fossil fuel-intensive production systems (carbon lock-in) will increase the societal, economic and political strain of a rapid low-carbon transition after 2030 (high confidence)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.5.1_p4,fossil fuel;methane;ozone;climate forcing,"The relationship between warming limits and near-term action is also affected by the warming contribution of non-CO2 greenhouse gases and other short-lived climate forcers (Section 3.3; AR6 WGI Section 6.7). The estimated budget values for limiting warming to 1.5°C–2°C already assume stringent reductions in non-CO2 greenhouse gases and non-CO2 climate forcing as found in 1.5°C–2°C pathways (Section 3.3 and Cross-Working Group Box 1 in this chapter; AR6 WGI Section 5.5 and Box 5.2 in Chapter 5). Further variations in non-CO2 warming observed across 1.5°C–2°C pathways can vary the median estimate for the remaining carbon budget by 220 GtCO2 (AR6 WGI Section 5.5). In 1.5°C–2°C pathways, the non-CO2 warming contribution differs strongly between the near, medium and long term. Changes to the atmospheric composition of short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs) dominate the warming response in the near term (AR6 WGI Section 6.7). CO2 reductions are combined with strong reductions in air pollutant emissions due to rapid reduction in fossil fuel combustion and in some cases the assumption of stringent air quality policies (Rao et al. 2017b; Smith et al. 2020c). As air pollutants exert a net-cooling effect, their reduction drives up non-CO2 warming in the near term, which can be attenuated by the simultaneous reduction of methane and black carbon (Shindell and Smith 2019; Smith et al. 2020b) (AR6 WGI Section 6.7). After 2030, the reduction in methane concentrations and associated reductions in tropospheric ozone levels tend to dominate so that a peak and decline in non-CO2 forcing and non-CO2-induced warming can occur before net zero CO2 is reached (Figure 3.29) (Rogelj et al. 2018 a). The more stringent the reductions in methane and other short-lived warming agents such as black carbon, the lower this peak and the earlier the decline of non-CO2 warming, leading to a reduction of warming rates and overall warming in the near to medium term (Harmsen et al. 2020; Smith et al. 2020b). This is important for keeping warming below a tight warming limit that is already reached around mid-century as is the case in 1.5°C pathways (Xu and Ramanathan 2017). Early and deep reductions of methane emissions, and other short-lived warming agents such as black carbon, provide space for residual CO2-induced warming until the point of net zero CO2 emissions is reached (see purple lines in Figure 3.29). Such emissions reductions have also been advocated due to co-benefits for, for example, reducing air pollution (Rao et al. 2016; Shindell et al. 2017a, 2018; Shindell and Smith 2019; Rauner et al. 2020a; Vandyck et al. 2020)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.5.2_p3,fossil fuel,"The assessed emission ranges from implementing the unconditional (unconditional and conditional) elements of NDCs announced prior to COP26 implies an emissions gap to cost-effective mitigation pathways of 19–26 (16–23) GtCO2-eq in 2030 for limiting warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot and 10–16 (6–14) GtCO2-eq in 2030 for limiting warming to 2°C (>67%) (Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 4). The emissions gap gives rise to a number of mitigation challenges (Kriegler et al. 2013a, 2018a,b; Luderer et al. 2013, 2018; Rogelj et al. 2013a; Fawcett et al. 2015; Riahi et al. 2015; Fujimori et al. 2016b; Strefler et al. 2018; Winning et al. 2019; SEI et al. 2020; UNEP 2020): (i) larger transitional challenges post-2030 to still remain under the warming limit, in particular higher CO2 emissions reduction rates and technology transition rates required during 2030–2050; (ii) larger lock-in into carbon-intensive infrastructure and increased risk of stranded fossil fuel assets (Section 3.5.2.2); and (iii) larger reliance on CDR to reach net zero CO2 more rapidly and compensate excess emissions in the second half of the century (Section 3.5.2.1). All these factors exacerbate the socio-economic strain of implementing the transition, leading to an increased risk of overshooting the warming and a higher risk of climate change impacts (Drouet et al. 2021)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.5.2_p10,fossil fuel;Biomass,"There is also a profound impact on the underlying transition of energy and land use (Figure 3.30f–h and Table 3.6). Scenarios following NDCs until 2030 show a much smaller reduction in fossil fuel use, a slower growth in renewable energy use, and a smaller reduction in CO2 and CH4 land-use emissions in 2030 compared to immediate action scenarios. This is then followed by a much faster reduction of land-use emissions and fossil fuels, and a larger increase of nuclear energy, bioenergy and non-biomass renewable energy during the medium term in order to get close to the levels of the immediate action pathways in 2050. This is combined with a larger amount of net negative CO2 emissions that are used to compensate the additional emissions before 2030. The faster transition during 2030–2050 is taking place from a greater investment in fossil fuel infrastructure and lower deployment of low-carbon alternatives in 2030, adding to the socio-economic challenges to realise the higher transition rates (Section 3.5.2.2). Therefore, these pathways also show higher mitigation costs, particularly during the period 2030–2050, than immediate action scenarios (Section 3.6.1 and Figure 3.34d) (Liu et al. 2016; Kriegler et al. 2018a; Vrontisi et al. 2018). Given these circumstances and the fact the modelling of socio-political and institutional constraints is limited in Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) (Gambhir et al. 2019; Köhler et al. 2019; Hirt et al. 2020; Keppo et al. 2021), the feasibility of realising these scenarios is assessed to be lower (Gambhir et al. 2017; Napp et al. 2017; Brutschin et al. 2021) (cf. Section 3.8), increasing the risk of an overshoot of climate goals."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.5.2.2_p1,fossil fuel,"There already exists a substantial and growing carbon lock-in today, as measured by committed emissions associated with existing long-lived infrastructure (Section 2.7 and Figure 2.31). If existing fossil fuel infrastructure would continue to be operated as historically, it would entail CO2 emissions exceeding the carbon budget for 1.5°C (Section 2.7.2 and Figure 2.32). However, owner-operators and societies may choose to retire existing infrastructure earlier than in the past, and committed emissions are thus contingent on the competitiveness of non-emitting alternative technologies and climate policy ambition. Therefore, in mitigation pathways, some infrastructure may become stranded assets. Stranded assets have been defined as ‘assets that have suffered from unanticipated or premature write-downs, devaluations or conversion to liabilities’ (Caldecott 2017)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.5.2.2_p3,fossil fuel,"Some publications have suggested that stranded long-lived assets may be even more important outside of the power sector. While stranded power sector assets by 2050 could reach up to USD1.8 trillion in scenarios consistent with a 2°C target, Saygin et al. (2019) found a range of USD5–11 trillion in the buildings sector. Muldoon-Smith and Greenhalgh (2019) have even estimated a potential value at risk for global real estate assets up to USD21 trillion. More broadly, the set of economic activities that are potentially affected by a low-carbon transition is wide and includes also energy-intensive industries, transport and housing, as reflected in the concept of climate policy relevant sectors introduced in Battiston et al. (2017). The sectoral distribution and amount of stranded assets differ across countries (Fisch-Romito et al. 2021). Capital for fossil fuel production and distribution represents a larger share of potentially stranded assets in fossil fuel-producing countries such as the United States and Russia. Electricity generation would be a larger share of total stranded assets in emerging countries because this capital is relatively new compared to its operational lifetime. Conversely, buildings could represent a larger part of stranded capital in more developed countries and regions such as the USA, EU or even Russia because of high market value and low turnover rate."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.5.2.2_p4,fossil fuel,"Many quantitative estimates of stranded assets along mitigation pathways have focused on fossil fuel power plants in pathways characterised by mitigation ambition until 2030 corresponding to the NDCs followed by strengthened action afterwards to limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower (Bertram et al. 2015a; Iyer et al. 2015b; Lane et al. 2016; Farfan and Breyer 2017; van Soest et al. 2017a; Kriegler et al. 2018a; Luderer et al. 2018; Cui et al. 2019; Saygin et al. 2019; SEI et al. 2020). Pathways following NDCs announced prior to COP26 until 2030 do not show a significant reduction of coal, oil and gas use (Figure 3.30f–h and Table 3.6) compared to immediate action pathways. Stranded coal power assets are evaluated to be higher by a factor of two to three if action is strengthened after 2030 rather than now (Iyer et al. 2015b; Cui et al. 2019). There is high agreement that the later climate policies are implemented, the higher the expected stranded assets and the societal, economic and political strain of strengthening action. Associated price increases for carbon-intensive goods and transitional macro-economic costs have been found to scale with the emissions gap in 2030 (Kriegler et al. 2013a). At the aggregate level of the whole global economy, Rozenberg et al. (2015) showed that each year of delaying the start of mitigation decreases the required CO2 intensity of new production by 20–50 gCO2 per USD. Carbon lock-in can have a long-lasting effect on future emissions trajectories after 2030. Luderer et al. (2018) compared cost-effective pathways with immediate action to limit warming to 1.5°C–2°C with pathways following the NDCs until 2030 and adopting the pricing policy of the cost-effective pathways thereafter, and found that the majority of additional CO2 emissions from carbon lock-in occur after 2030, reaching a cumulative amount of 290 (160–330) GtCO2 by 2100 (Section 2.7.2). Early action and avoidance of investments in new carbon-intensive assets can minimise these risks."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.5.3_p4,fossil fuel,"One approach relies on augmenting initially moderate emissions-pricing policies with robust anticipation of ratcheting up climate action in the future (Spencer et al. 2015). If announcements of strong future climate policies are perceived to be credible, they can help to prevent carbon lock-in as investors anticipating high future costs of GHG emissions would reduce investment into fossil fuel infrastructure, such as coal power plants (Bauer et al. 2018b). However, the effectiveness of such announcements strongly hinges on their credibility. If investors believe that policymakers could drop them if anticipatory action did not occur, they may not undertake such action."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.5.3_p6,fossil fuel,"The most common approach relies on strengthening regulatory policies beyond current policy trends, also motivated by the finding that such policies have so far been employed more often than comprehensive carbon pricing (Kriegler et al. 2018a; Roelfsema et al. 2018; Fekete et al. 2021; IEA 2021 a; van Soest et al. 2021a). Some studies have focused on generic regulatory policies such as low-carbon support policies, fossil fuel-sunset policies, and resource-efficiency policies (Bertram et al. 2015b; Hatfield-Dodds et al. 2017). Bertram et al. (2015b) found that a moderate carbon price combined with a coal moratorium and ambitious low-carbon support policies can limit efficiency losses until 2030 if emissions pricing is raised thereafter to limit warming to 2°C. They also showed that all three components are needed to achieve this outcome. Hatfield-Dodds et al. (2017) found that resource efficiency can lower 2050 emissions by an additional 15–20% while boosting near-term economic growth. The International Energy Agency (IEA 2021 a) developed a detailed net zero scenario for the global energy sector characterised by a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels, a massive clean energy and electrification push, and the stabilisation of energy demand, leading to 10 GtCO2 lower emissions from energy use in 2030 than in a scenario following the announced pledges."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.5.3_p9,fossil fuel,"Figure 3.31 shows the intermediate position of accelerated action pathways derived by van Soest et al. (2021a) between pathways that follow the NDCs until 2030 and immediate action pathways limiting warming to 2°C (>67%). Accelerated action is able to reduce the abrupt shifts in emissions, fossil fuel use and low-carbon power generation in 2030 and also limits peak warming more effectively than NDC pathways. But primarily due to the moderate carbon price assumptions (Figure 3.31b), the reductions in emissions and particular fossil fuel use are markedly smaller than what would be obtained in the case of immediate action. The assessment shows that accelerated action until 2030 can have significant benefits in terms of reducing the mitigation challenges from following the NDCs until 2030. But putting a significant value on GHG emissions reductions globally remains a key element of moving onto 1.5°C–2°C pathways. The vast majority of pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower, independently of their differences in near-term emission developments, converge to a global mitigation regime putting a significant value on GHG emission reductions in all regions and sectors."

The regional pattern of power sector investments broadly mirrors the global picture. However, the bulk of investment requirements are in medium- and low-income regions. These results from the AR6 scenarios database corroborate the findings from McCollum et al. (2018a), Zhou et al. (2019) and Bertram et al. (2021)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#box-3.5_p3,fossil fuel,"If GDP or consumption in mitigation pathways are below the reference scenario levels, they are reported as losses or macroeconomic costs. Such cost estimates give an indication of how economic activity slows relative to the reference scenario; they do not necessarily describe, in absolute terms, a reduction of economic output or consumption levels relative to previous years along the pathway. Aggregate mitigation costs depend strongly on the modelling framework used and the assumptions about the reference scenario against which mitigation costs are measured, in particular whether the reference scenario is, or not, on the efficiency frontier of the economy. If the economy is assumed to be at the efficiency frontier in the reference scenario, mitigation inevitably leads to actual costs, at least in the short-run until the production frontier evolves with technical and structural change. Starting from a reference scenario that is not on the efficiency frontier opens the possibility to simultaneously reduce emissions and obtain macroeconomic gains, depending on the design and implementation of mitigation policies. A number of factors can result in reference scenarios below the efficiency frontier, for instance distorting labour taxes and/or fossil fuel subsidies, misallocation or under-utilisation of production factors such as involuntary unemployment, imperfect information or non-rational behaviours. Although these factors are pervasive, the modelling frameworks used to construct mitigation pathways are often limited in their ability to represent them (Köberle et al. 2021)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.6.4.1_p2,fossil fuel,"Mitigation affects work through multiple channels, which impacts geographies, sectors and skill categories differently (Fankhaeser et al. 2008; Bowen et al. 2018; Malerba and Wiebe 2021). Aggregate employment impacts of mitigation pathways mainly depend on the aggregate macroeconomic effect of mitigation (Sections 3.6.1 and 3.6.2) and of mitigation policy design and implementation (Freire-González 2018) (Section 4.2.6.3). Most studies that quantify overall employment implications of mitigation policies are conducted at the national or regional scales (Section 4.2.6.3), or sectoral scales (e.g., see Chapter 6 for energy sector jobs). The evidence is limited at the multinational or global scale, but studies generally find small differences in aggregate employment in mitigation pathways compared to baselines: the sign of the difference depends on the assumptions and modelling frameworks used and the policy design tested, with some studies or policy design cases leading to small increases in employment (Chateau and Saint-Martin 2013; Pollitt et al. 2015; Barker et al. 2016; Garcia-Casals et al. 2019; Fujimori et al. 2020a; Vrontisi et al. 2020; Malerba and Wiebe 2021) and other studies or policy design cases leading to small decreases (Chateau and Saint-Martin 2013; Vandyck et al. 2016). The small variations in aggregate employment hide substantial reallocation of jobs across sectors, with jobs creation in some sectors and jobs destruction in others. Mitigation action through thermal renovation of buildings, installation and maintenance of low-carbon generation, and the expansion of public transit lead to job creation, while jobs are lost in fossil fuel extraction, energy supply and energy-intensive sectors in mitigation pathways (von Stechow et al. 2015, 2016; Barker et al. 2016; Fuso Nerini et al. 2018; Perrier and Quirion 2018; Pollitt and Mercure 2018; Dominish et al. 2019; Garcia-Casals et al. 2019). In the energy sector, job losses in the fossil fuel sector are found to be compensated by gains in wind and solar jobs, leading to a net increase in energy sector jobs in 2050 in a mitigation pathway compatible with stabilisation of the temperature increase below 2°C (Pai et al. 2021). Employment effects also differ by geographies, with energy-importing regions benefiting from net job creations but energy-exporting regions experiencing very small gains or suffering from net job destruction (Barker et al. 2016; Pollitt and Mercure 2018; Garcia-Casals et al. 2019; Malerba and Wiebe 2021). Coal phase-out raises acute issues of just transition for the coal-dependent countries (Spencer et al. 2018; Jakob et al. 2020) (Section 4.5 and Box 6.2)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.7.4.1_p1,fossil fuel;sea level rise,"Climate change alters the production of energy through changes in temperature (hydropower, fossil fuel, nuclear, solar, bioenergy, transmission and pipelines), precipitation (hydropower, fossil fuel, nuclear and bioenergy), windiness (wind and wave), and cloudiness (solar) ( high confidence). Increases in temperature reduce efficiencies of thermal power plants (e.g., fossil fuel and nuclear plants) with air-cooled condensers by 0.4–0.7% per °C increase in ambient temperature (Cronin et al. 2018a; Simioni and Schaeffer 2019; Yalew, S.G. et al. 2020). Potentials and costs for renewable energy technologies are also affected by climate change, though with considerable regional variation and uncertainty (Gernaat et al. 2021). Biofuel yields could increase or decrease depending on the level of warming, changes in precipitation, and the effect of CO2 fertilisation (Calvin et al. 2013; Kyle et al. 2014; Gernaat et al. 2021). Coastal energy facilities could potentially be impacted by sea level rise (Brown et al. 2014)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.8.1_p2,fossil fuel,"Regarding scenarios, the feasibility ‘what’ question is the one most commonly dealt with in the literature, though most of the studies have focused on expanding low-carbon system, and yet political constraints might arise mostly from phasing out fossil fuel-based ones (Spencer et al. 2018; Fattouh et al. 2019). The ‘when and where’ dimension can also be related to the scenario assessment, but only insofar that the models generating them can differentiate time and geographical contextual factors. Distinguishing mitigation potential by regional institutional capacity has a significant influence on the costs of stabilising climate (Iyer et al. 2015c). The ‘whom’ question is the most difficult to capture by scenarios, given the multitude of actors involved as well as their complex interactions. The focus of socio-technical transition sciences on the co-evolutionary processes can shed light on the dynamics of feasibility (Nielsen et al. 2020)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.3.4.1_p6,fossil fuel,"First, urban land areas will expand significantly by 2050 – by as much as 211% (see SSP5 forecast in Huang et al. 2019), but likely within a large potential range of about 43–106% over the 2015 extent by 2050 – to accommodate the growing urban population (Table 8.1). Globally, there are large uncertainties and variations among the studies – and between the SSPs – about the rates and extent of future urban expansion, owing to uncertainties about economic development and population growth (ranges of estimates are provided in Table 8.1). Overall, the largest urban extents are forecasted under SSP5 (fossil fuel-intensive development) for both 2050 and 2100, whereas the smallest forecasted urban extents are under SSP3 (‘regional rivalry’). Forecasted global urban extents could reach between 1 and 2.2 million km 2 (median of 1.4 million km 2, a 106% increase) in 2050 under SSP5, and between 0.85 and 1.5 million km 2 (median of 1 million km 2, a 43% increase) in 2050 under SSP3. Under SSP1, which is characterised by a focus on sustainability with more compact, low-emissions development, urban extents could reach 1 million km 2 (range of 0.9 to 2 million km 2, a 49% increase) in 2050. By 2100, the forecasted urban extents reach between 1.4 and 3.6 million km 2 (median 2.5 million km 2) under SSP5 and between 1 and 1.5 million km 2 (median 1.3 million km 2) under SSP3. Across the studies, substantially larger amounts of urban land expansion are expected after 2050 under SSP5 compared to other SSPs."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.4.3.1_p3,fossil fuel,"In its simplest form, electrification involves the process of replacing fossil fuel-based technologies with electrified innovations such as electric vehicles, buses, streetcars, and trains (Sections 10.3 and 10.4), heat pumps, PVs (Section 6.4.2.1), electric cook-stoves (Section 9.8.2.1), and other technologies (Stewart et al. 2018). Cost-effective decarbonisation of energy use can be supported by electrification in urban areas if there is also demand-side flexibility for power, heat, mobility, and water with sector coupling (Guelpa et al. 2019; Pfeifer et al. 2021). Overall, demand-side flexibility across sectors in urban areas is supported by smart charging, electric mobility, electrified urban rail, power-to-heat, demand side response, and water desalination (Lund et al. 2015; Calvillo et al. 2016; Salpakari et al. 2016; Newman 2017; Meschede 2019)."

Also, models overpredict precipitation frequency but have weaker intensity, although comparison with observed datasets is complex as there are large differences in intensity among them (Herold et al., 2016; Pendergrass and Deser, 2017; Trenberth et al., 2017). Regarding trends in precipitation intensity, models have also been shown to reproduce the compensation between increasing heavy precipitation and decreasing light to moderate rainfall (Thackeray et al., 2018b), a characteristic found in the observational record (Gu and Adler, 2018).

Increasing air temperatures have been linked to permafrost degradation and altered hydrological regimes (2.3.3.2; Figure 2.4a; 2.4.3.9; Box 5.1), which have led to rapid changes in plant communities and bio-geochemical cycling (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Liljedahl et al., 2016; Swindles et al., 2016; Voigt et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017b; Voigt et al., 2020; Sim et al., 2021).

Permafrost thaw in peatland-rich landscapes can also cause local drying through increased hydrological connectivity and runoff (Connon et al., 2014). In the first decades following thaw, increases in methane, CO2 and nitrous oxide emissions have been recorded from peatland sites, depending on surface moisture conditions (Schuur et al., 2009; O’Donnell et al., 2012; Elberling et al., 2013; Matveev et al., 2016; Euskirchen et al., 2020; Hugelius et al., 2020).

Costa Rica offers an example on how reforestation can help achieve Paris Agreement objectives. Reforestation through natural regeneration on abandoned pastures boosted forest cover from 48% in 2005 to 53.4% in 2010 (Reid et al., 2019; Cárdenas et al., 2021). Some key success factors included a strong institutional context, fiscal and financial incentives for reforestation, conservation measures such as payment for environmental services, cattle ranch subsidy reform and a historically strong enforcement and focus on land titles that favoured the restoration of lands. Uruguay offers another example, with the farm sector contribution of 32.8% of all exports and 73.8% of the country’s emissions, so decarbonisation is not just an environmental issue but an economic competitiveness one as well. In the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) submitted to the UNFCCC in 2015, Uruguay set a specific target for the agriculture sector to reduce enteric methane emissions intensity per kilogram of beef (live weight) by 33% to 46% in 2030 by improving efficiency of beef production by controlling the grazing intensity to increase animal intake, reproductive efficiency and daily weight gain (Picasso et al., 2014)."

Methane emissions reductions are thus attainable at relatively lower GHG prices but are at the same time limited in scope in most 1.5°C–2°C pathways. Deeper methane emissions reductions by 2050 could further constrain the peak warming. N2O emissions are reduced too, but similar to CH4, emission reductions saturate for more stringent climate goals.

The GHG net zero emissions year is typically around 10–40 years later than the carbon neutrality. Residual non-CO2 emissions at the time of reaching net zero CO2 range between 5–11 GtCO2-eq in pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower.

The linear relationship used in the AR6 WGI assessment between peak temperature and the warming as a result of non-CO2 emissions (based on the SR1.5 data) is shown in the right panel of Figure 2 (dashed line). In the AR6 WGIII approach, the non-CO2 warming for each single scenario is based on the individual scenario characteristics. This is shown in the same figure by plotting the outcomes of scenario outcomes of a range of models (dots). The lines show the fitted data for individual models, emphasising the clear differences across models and the relationship with peak warming (policy level). In some scenarios, stringent non-CO2 emission reductions provide an option to reach more stringent climate goals with the same carbon budget. This is especially the case for scenarios with a very low non-CO2 warming, for instance, as a result of methane reductions through diet change. The left panel shows how these differences impact estimates of the remaining carbon budget. While the AR6 scenarios database includes a broad range of non-CO2 emission projections the overall range is still very consistent with the WGI relationship and the estimated uncertainty with a ±220 GtCO2 range (see also Figure 5 in Annex III.II.2.5.1)."

The AR6 WGI estimated remaining carbon budgets until the time of reaching net zero CO2 emissions for a range of warming limits, taking into account historical CO2 emissions and projections of the warming from non-CO2 forcing agents (Box 3.4 in Section 3.3, AR6 WGI Section 5.5)."

cleaned_content/wg1/Chapter03#3.4.2_p4,Biomass,"CMIP6 models improve on CMIP5 models in producing slightly increased SCE versus CMIP5, correcting the low bias in CMIP5 (Mudryk et al., 2020). The linear relationship noted above between GSAT and SCE also exists in CMIP6 (Mudryk et al., 2020). Like CMIP5, the CMIP6 models capture the negative trend in spring snow cover that has occurred in recent decades (Figure 3.22). However, the median CMIP6 model now produces slightly stronger post-1981 declines in the March to April mean SCE than the CMIP5 median (Mudryk et al., 2020). Until about 1980, the models produce a generally stable March to April SCE, but after that a substantial decline, reaching a loss of about 2 × 106km2 in 2012–2017 relative to the 1971–2000 average. Compared to earlier studies which found that models underestimate observed trends for the 1979–2005 period (Brutel-Vuilmet et al., 2013), both CMIP5 and CMIP6 models show improved agreement with the observations over the period to 2017 (Figure 3.22). One remaining concern is a failure of most CMIP6 models to correctly represent the relationship between snow cover extent and snow mass, reflecting too slow seasonal increases and decreases of SCE in the models (Mudryk et al., 2020)."

Declines in the abundance of cold-stenothermal species, particularly the Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus), coregonids  and smelt, and increases in eurythermal fish (e.g., the thermo-tolerant carp Cyprinus carpio, common bream, pike perch, roach and shad) have been observed in northern temperate lakes associated with warming trends (medium evidence, high agreement ) (Jeppesen et al., 2012; Jeppesen et al., 2014). These changes increase predation pressure on zooplankton and reduce grazing pressure on phytoplankton, which may result in higher phytoplankton biomass (De Senerpont Domis et al., 2013; Jeppesen et al., 2014; Adrian et al., 2016). Reduction in lake mixing lowers the concentration of nutrients in the epilimnion and may lead to higher silicon-to-phosphorous ratios that negatively affect diatom growth (Yankova et al., 2017) or overall primary productivity (see Section 2.4.4.5.2)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.2.3.2_p2,Biomass;anthropogenic;anthropogenic climate change,"In a study of 1567 lakes across Europe and North America, Kakouei (2021) identified climate change as the major driver of increases in phytoplankton biomass in remote areas with minimal LULCC. Greater temperature variability can be more important than long-term temperature trends as a driver of zooplankton biodiversity (Shurin et al., 2010). Reductions of winter severity attributed to anthropogenic climate change are increasing winter algal biomass, and motile and phototropic species, at the expense of mixotrophic species (Özkundakci et al., 2016; Hampton et al., 2017)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.2.3.2_p4,Biomass,"Observed effects of climate change on freshwater invertebrates are variable (Knouft and Ficklin, 2017). In glacier-fed streams globally, climate change has caused community turnover and changes in abundances in terms of increased generalist and decreased specialist species (Lencioni, 2018; Cauvy-Fraunié and Dangles, 2019). In turn, dragonflies in flowing waters, monitored during the warming period from 1988 through 2006 in Europe, did not show consistent changes in their distribution (Grewe et al., 2013), reviewed in Knouft and Ficklin (2017). Long-term trends in the species composition and community structure of stream macro-invertebrates, specifically a general trend for decreases in species characteristic of cold, fast-flowing waters and increases of thermophilic species typical of stagnant or slow-moving waters, have been attributed to climate change (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Daufresne et al., 2007; Chessman, 2015). A study of 14 geothermal streams reported simplified food web structures and shortened pathways of energy flux between consumers and resources (O’Gorman et al., 2019). Macrophytes benefit from rising water temperatures, but increased shading from increased phytoplankton biomass could offset this (Hossain et al., 2016; Short et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017a)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.3.5_p5,Biomass,"Remote sensing shows overall increasing trends in both the annual maximum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and annual mean NDVI in global grassland ecosystems between 1982 and 2011 (Gao et al., 2016). Multiple lines of evidence indicate that changes in grassland productivity are positively correlated with increases in mean annual precipitation (Hoover et al., 2014; Brookshire and Weaver, 2015; Gang et al., 2015; Gao et al., 2016; Wilcox et al., 2017; Wan et al., 2018). Increasing temperatures positively impact grassland production and biomass, especially in temperature-limited regions (Piao et al., 2014; Gao et al., 2016). However, it is expected that grasslands in hot areas will decrease production as temperatures increase (limited evidence, low agreement ) (Gang et al., 2015). Nevertheless, grassland responses to warming and drought are being ameliorated by increasing CO2 and associated improved water-use efficiency (Roy et al., 2016). For example, in a cool temperate grassland experiment, warming led to a longer growing season and elevated CO2 further extended growing by conserving water, which enabled most species to remain active longer (medium evidence, medium agreement ) (Reyes-Fox et al., 2014)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.3.6_p3,Biomass;carbon sink,"Increases in productivity of tropical forests (Gatti et al., 2014; Brienen et al., 2015; Baccini et al., 2017), Africa and southeast Asia (Qie et al., 2017) have been attributed to elevated CO2 (robust evidence, medium agreement ) (Ballantyne et al., 2012; Brienen et al., 2015; Sitch et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2016; Mitchard, 2018). The rates of these increases have been slowing down in the central Amazon (Brienen et al., 2015; de Meira Junior et al., 2020) and Southeast Asia (Qie et al., 2017). In contrast, the carbon sink (and hence the rate of biomass gain) in intact African forests was stable until 2010 and has only recently started to decline, indicating asynchronous carbon sink saturation in Amazonia and Africa, the difference being driven by rates of tree mortality (Hubau et al., 2020). At the global level, Hubau et al. (2020) argue that the carbon sink associated with intact tropical forests peaked in the 1990s and is now in decline."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.3.6_p5,Biomass,"Lianas (long-stemmed woody vines) generally negatively impact trees, significantly reducing the growth of heavily infested trees (Reis et al., 2020). Lianas would benefit from climate change and disturbance (LingZi et al., 2014; Hodgkins et al., 2018). The extent of their suitable niche can increase (Taylor and Kumar, 2016), thereby decreasing forest biomass accumulation (robust evidence, high agreement ) (van der Heijden et al., 2013; Fauset et al., 2015; Estrada-Villegas et al., 2020)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.3.6_p6,Biomass;Deforestation,"Climate change continues to degrade forests by reducing resilience to pests and diseases, increasing species invasion, facilitating pathogen spread (Malhi et al., 2014; Deb et al., 2018) and intensifying fire risk and potential dieback (Lapola et al., 2018; Marengo et al., 2018). Drought, temperature increases and forest fragmentation interact to increase the prevalence of fires in tropical forests (robust evidence, high agreement ). Warming increases water stress in trees (Corlett, 2016) and, together with forest fragmentation, dramatically increases the desiccation of forest canopies—resulting in deforestation that then leads to even hotter and drier regional climates (Malhi et al., 2014; Lewis et al., 2015). Warming and drought increase the invasion of grasses into forest edges and increase fire risk (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Brando et al., 2014; Balch et al., 2015; Lewis et al., 2015). Droughts and fires additively increase mortality and, consequently, reduce canopy cover and above-ground biomass (Cross-Chapter Paper 7) (Brando et al., 2014, 2020; Balch et al., 2015; Lewis et al., 2015)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.4.5.2 _p2,Biomass,"Macrophyte growth in freshwaters is likely to increase with rising water temperatures, atmospheric CO2 and precipitation (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Dhir, 2015; Hossain et al., 2016; Short et al., 2016; Reitsema et al., 2018). Nonetheless, primary productivity in rivers is variable and unpredictable (Bernhardt et al., 2018) because seasonal variations in temperature and light are uncorrelated, frequent high-flow events reduce biomass of autotrophs and droughts can strand and desiccate autotrophs."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5_p1,Biomass;ecosystem services,"Under the risk assessment framework that was introduced in AR5 (IPCC, 2014b), risk means the probability of harmful consequences resulting from climate change. It results from the interaction of vulnerability, exposure and hazard and can be represented as the probability of occurrence of hazardous events or trends multiplied by the impacts if these events or trends occur (see Chapter 1, this report). The framework defines vulnerability as a pre-existing condition, incorporating the extent to which species or ecosystems are susceptible to, or unable to cope with, the adverse effects of climate change. Vulnerable species have limited adaptive capacity, stemming from physiological and behavioural constraints, limited dispersal abilities and restricted resource requirements or capacities for distributional and genetic changes (Foden et al., 2013; Cizauskas et al., 2017; Foden et al., 2019). Traits that render entire ecosystems vulnerable are harder to define, but it is clear that vulnerabilities are high in the coldest habitats, in those with limited geographic ranges such as low-lying islands and in specialised, restricted habitats such as serpentine outcrops in California (Anacker and Harrison, 2012) and dry meadows in Fennoscandia and Tibet (Yang et al., 2018a). Ecosystem vulnerability can depend critically on the fates of plants that function as ‘foundation species’, providing community biomass above and below the ground, structuring habitat for fauna and providing ecosystem services such as erosion control (Camac et al., 2021)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.2.6_p1,Biomass,"Key factors affecting the future distribution of tropical humid and dry forests are amounts and seasonalities of precipitation, increased temperatures, prolonged droughts and droughted-moderated fires (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Bonai et al., 2016; Corlett, 2016; Lyra et al., 2017; Anderson et al., 2018; da Silva et al., 2018 ; Fontes et al., 2018; O’Connell et al., 2018; Aguirre-Gutiérrez et al., 2019; Bartlett et al., 2019; Brando et al., 2019; Stan and Sanchez-Azofeifa, 2019). The probability of severe drought is projected to quadruple in natural areas in Brazil with >2°C warming (Barbosa and Lakshmi Kumar, 2016; Marengo et al., 2020). Most multi-model studies assuming rapid economic growth/business-as-usual scenarios (A2, A1B and RCP8.5) show an increase in future woody biomass and areas of woody cover towards the end of the 21st century in temperate regions (Boit et al., 2016; Nabuurs et al., 2017) and tropical forests in East Africa (Ross et al., 2021) but a decrease in the remaining tropical regions (Anadón et al., 2014a; Boit et al., 2016; Lyra et al., 2017; Nabuurs et al., 2017; Maia et al., 2020). Terrestrial species are predicted to shift to cooler temperatures and higher elevations (Pecl et al., 2017). Tropical species are more susceptible to climate warming than temperate species (Rehm and Feeley, 2016; Sentinella et al., 2020). This susceptibility will be exacerbated by road-building increasing the ease of access into forests (Brinck et al., 2017; Taubert et al., 2018; Bovendorp et al., 2019; Senior et al., 2019). Furthermore, most tropical cloud forest species are unable to invade grasslands and this will increase the risk of extinctions in tropical cloud forests (Rehm and Feeley, 2015)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.3.4_p6,Biomass;carbon sink,"Substantial climate change-driven impacts on tropical tree cover and vegetation type are projected in all studies, irrespective of whether or not the degree amounts to a forest “dieback” (Sections 2.4.3.6, 2.4.4.3, 2.5.2.6, 2.5.3.3) (Davies-Barnard et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2016a; Zemp et al., 2017a; Canadell et al., 2021) . Accordingly, models also suggest a continuation of tropical forests acting as carbon sinks (Huntingford et al., 2013; Mercado et al., 2018). A recent study combining field plot data with statistical models (Hubau et al., 2020) indicates that, in the Amazonian and possibly also in the African forest, the carbon sink in above-ground biomass already declined in the three decades up to 2015. This trend is distinct in the Amazon whereas data from Africa suggests a possible decline after 2010. The authors estimate the vegetation carbon sink in 2030–2040 to decline to zero±0.205 PgC yr -1 in the Amazon and to 0.26±0.215 PgC yr -1 in Africa (a loss of 14% compared to the present). Their results suggest that, over time, CO2 fertilisation is outweighed by the impacts of higher temperatures and drought that enhance tree mortality and diminish growth. The degree of thermal resilience of tropical forests is still uncertain, however (Sullivan et al., 2020)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.3.6.1_p4,Biomass,"Changes in algal biomass development and the spread of cyanobacteria blooms, related to global warming, resemble those triggered by eutrophication with the well-known negative effects on the services lakes provide, particularly for drinking water provision and recreation (robust evidence, high agreement , high confidence) (Carvalho et al., 2013; Adrian et al., 2016; Gozlan et al., 2019)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.3.2.4_p12,Biomass,"The upper limit of alpine vegetation (paramo) shifted upslope 500 m in the Chimborazo (Morueta-Holme et al., 2015), yet the upper forest limit (the ecotone between forest and alpine vegetation) is migrating at slower rates or not at all (Harsch et al., 2009; Rehm and Feeley, 2015b), so it is expected to be a major barrier to migration to several montane species, leading to population reductions and biodiversity losses (Lutz et al., 2013; Rehm and Feeley, 2015a). Shifts in tree species distribution may result in decreased above-ground carbon stocks and productivity in tropical mountain forests (high confidence) (Feeley et al., 2011; Duque et al., 2015; Fadrique et al., 2018; Duque et al., 2021), a biomass loss that will only be partially offset through increased recruitment and growth of lowland species migrating upslope. Water scarcity can enhance tree mortality and decrease above-ground carbon stocks (Álvarez-Dávila et al., 2017; McDowell et al., 2020). The agricultural frontier of crops, such as potatoes or maize, is moving upwards (high confidence), following the freezing level height upward displacement (Morueta-Holme et al., 2015; Skarbø and VanderMolen, 2016; Schauwecker et al., 2017; Vuille et al., 2018). Modelling exercises agree with the observed impacts in species, ecosystem processes, crop impacts and related pests and diseases (high confidence) (Cernusak et al., 2013; Tovar et al., 2013; Ramirez-Villegas et al., 2014; Ovalle-Rivera et al., 2015; van der Sleen et al., 2015; Lowe et al., 2017). Agricultural options are changing as a result of intra-seasonal temperature variation (Ponce, 2020). Changes in the timing and amount of precipitation are also impacting agriculture (Table 12.4) (Heikkinen, 2017; Altea, 2020)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.3.3.4_p3,Biomass;Deforestation,"Several vector-driven diseases such as malaria and leishmaniasis are endemic in the Amazon region; however, socio-environmental changes are altering their natural dynamics (Confalonieri et al., 2014b). An important relationship between the outbreak of infectious diseases and changes in climatic events (e.g., droughts, floods, heat waves, ENSO) or environmental events (e.g., deforestation, dam construction and habitat fragmentation) has been found to exist for the Brazilian Amazon (medium confidence: medium evidence, high agreement ) (Pan et al., 2014; Filho et al., 2016; Nava et al., 2017; Ellwanger et al., 2020). These impacts are more severe in poor populations with limited access to health services (Pan et al., 2014; WHO and UNFCCC, 2020). In the case of Venezuela, the impact of climate change on the epidemiology of malaria has been studied, showing significant influence on transmission in the Amazonia area of the country (Figure 12.4) (Laguna et al., 2017). Other studies from Venezuela have documented the role of ENSO in dengue outbreaks (Vincenti-Gonzalez et al., 2018). Table 12.1 shows the changes observed in reproduction potential for dengue in the different sub-regions due to changes in rainfall and temperature. Forest fires pose a major threat to public health in the region because they relate to an increase in hospital admissions due to respiratory problems, mainly among children and the elderly (Figure 12.5). The amount of air pollutants detected is sometimes higher than that observed in large urban areas, especially during dry seasons when biomass burning increases (Aragão et al., 2016; de Oliveira Alves et al., 2017; Paralovo et al., 2019)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.3.3.4_p7,Biomass;Deforestation,"Droughts in 2009/2010 and 2015/2016 increased tree mortality rate in Amazon forests (Doughty et al., 2015; Feldpausch et al., 2016; Anderson et al., 2018b), while productivity showed no consistent change; some authors reported a drop in productivity (Feldpausch et al., 2016), while others found no significant changes (Brienen et al., 2015; Doughty et al., 2015). Nevertheless, the combined effect of increasing tree mortality with variations in growth results in a long-term decrease in C stocks in forest biomass, compromising the role of these forests as a C sink (high confidence) (Brienen et al., 2015; Rammig, 2020; Sullivan et al., 2020) (Figure 12.9). Under the RCP8.5 scenario for 2070, drought will increase the conversion of rainforest to savannah (medium confidence: medium evidence, high agreement ) (Anadón et al., 2014; Olivares et al., 2015; Sampaio et al., 2019). The transformation of rainforest into savannah will bring forth biodiversity loss and alterations in ecosystem functions and services (medium confidence: medium evidence, high agreement ) (Anadón et al., 2014; Olivares et al., 2015; Sampaio et al., 2019). In the Amazon basin, the synergistic effects of deforestation, fire, expansion of the agricultural frontier, infrastructure development, extractive activities, climate change and extreme events may exacerbate the risk of savannisation (medium confidence: medium evidence, high agreement ) (Nobre et al., 2016b; Bebbington et al., 2019; Sampaio et al., 2019; Rammig, 2020)."

Carbon sequestration in forests may be positively or adversely affected by climate change and CO2 fertilisation. On the one hand, elevated CO2 levels and higher temperatures could enhance tree growth rates, carbon sequestration, and timber and biomass production (Beach et al. 2015; Kim et al. 2017; Anderegg et al. 2020). On the other hand, climate change could lead to greater frequency and intensity of disturbance events in forests, such as fires, prolonged droughts, storms, pests and diseases (Kim et al. 2017; Anderegg et al. 2020). The impact of climate change on crop yields could also indirectly impact the availability of land for mitigation and AFOLU emissions (Calvin et al. 2013; Bajželj and Richards 2014; Kyle et al. 2014; Beach et al. 2015; Meijl et al. 2018). The impact is, however, uncertain, as discussed in AR6 WGII Chapter 5.

The effect of bioenergy and BECCS on mitigation depends on a variety of factors in modelled pathways. In the energy system, the emissions mitigation depends on the scale of deployment, the conversion technology, and the fuel displaced (Calvin et al. 2021). Limiting or excluding bioenergy and/or BECCS increases mitigation cost and may limit the ability of a model to reach a low warming level (Edmonds et al. 2013; Calvin et al. 2014b; Luderer et al. 2018; Muratori et al. 2020). In AFOLU, bioenergy can increase or decrease terrestrial carbon stocks and carbon sequestration, depending on the scale, biomass feedstock, land management practices, and prior land use (Calvin et al. 2014c; Wise et al. 2015; IPCC 2019a; Smith et al. 2019, 2020a; Calvin et al. 2021)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.4.1.3_p3,Biomass;carbon sequestration,"Pathways with very high biomass production for energy use typically include very high carbon prices in the energy system (Popp et al. 2017; Rogelj et al. 2018 b), little or no land policy (Calvin et al. 2014b), a high discount rate (Emmerling et al. 2019), and limited non-BECCS CDR options (e.g., afforestation, DACCS) (Chen and Tavoni 2013; Calvin et al. 2014b; Marcucci et al. 2017; Realmonte et al. 2019; Fuhrman et al. 2020). Higher levels of bioenergy consumption are likely to involve trade-offs with mitigation in other sectors, notably in construction (i.e., wood for material and structural products) and AFOLU (carbon stocks and future carbon sequestration), as well as trade-offs with sustainability (Section 3.7) and feasibility concerns (Section 3.8). Not all of these trade-offs are fully represented in all IAMs. Based on sectoral studies, the technical potential for bioenergy, when constraints for food security and environmental considerations are included, are 5–50 EJ yr –1 and 50–250 EJ yr –1 in 2050 for residues and dedicated biomass production systems, respectively (Chapter 7). Bioenergy deployment in IAMs is within the range of these potentials, with between 75 and 248 EJ yr –1 in 2050 in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot. Finally, IAMs do not include all potential feedstock and management practices, and have limited representation of institutions, governance, and local context (Brown et al. 2019; Butnar et al. 2020; Calvin et al. 2021)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.4.1.3_p4,Biomass;carbon sequestration,"The inclusion of CDR options, like BECCS, can affect the timing of emissions mitigation in IAM scenarios, that is, delays in mitigations actions are compensated by net negative emissions in the second half of the century. However, studies with limited net negative emissions in the long term require very rapid declines in emissions in the near term (van Vuuren et al. 2017). Especially in forest-based systems, increased harvesting of forests can perturb the carbon balance of forestry systems, increasing emissions for some period; the duration of this period of increased emissions, preceding net emissions reductions, can be very variable (Mitchell et al. 2012; Lamers and Junginger 2013; Röder et al. 2019; Hanssen et al. 2020; Cowie et al. 2021). However, the factors contributing to differences in recovery time are known (Mitchell et al. 2012; Zanchi et al. 2012; Lamers and Junginger 2013; Laganière et al. 2017; Röder et al. 2019). Some studies that consider market-mediated effects find that an increased demand for biomass from forests can provide incentives to maintain existing forests and potentially to expand forest areas, providing additional carbon sequestration as well as additional biomass (Dwivedi et al. 2014; Kim et al. 2018; Baker et al. 2019; Favero et al. 2020). However, these responses are uncertain and likely to vary geographically."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.4.2_p4,Biomass,"Stringent emissions reductions at the level required to limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or 1.5°C are achieved through increased electrification of end use, resulting in increased electricity generation in all pathways ( high confidence) (Rogelj et al. 2018 a; Azevedo et al. 2021) (Figure 3.23). Nearly all electricity in pathways likely  to limit warming to 2°C and below is from low- or no-carbon fuels (Rogelj et al. 2018 a; Azevedo et al. 2021), with different shares of nuclear, biomass, non-biomass renewables, and fossil CCS across pathways. Low-emissions scenarios also show increases in hydrogen use (Figure 3.23)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.4.6_p4,Biomass,"Limiting warming to likely 2°C (>67%) or lower can result in large-scale transformation of the land surface ( high confidence) (Popp et al. 2017; Rogelj et al. 2018 a,b; Brown et al. 2019; Roe et al. 2019). The scale of land transformation depends, inter alia, on the temperature goal and the mitigation options included (Popp et al. 2017; Rogelj et al. 2018 a; IPCC 2019a). Pathways with more demand-side mitigation options show less land transformation than those with more limited options (Grubler et al. 2018; van Vuuren et al. 2018; IPCC 2019a). Most of these pathways show increases in forest cover, with an increase of 322 million ha (–67 to 890 million ha) in 2050 in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot, whereas bottom-up models portray an economic potential of 300–500 million ha of additional forest (Chapter 7). Many IAM pathways also include large amounts of energy cropland area, to supply biomass for bioenergy and BECCS, with 199 (56–482) million ha in 2050 in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot. Large land transformations, such as afforestation/reforestation and widespread planting of energy crops, can have implications for biodiversity and sustainable development (Sections 3.7, 7.7.4 and 12.5)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.8.4_p2,Biomass,"One of the most relevant factors affecting mitigation pathways and their feasibility is the rate and kind of socio-economic development. For example, certain socio-economic trends and assumptions about policy effectiveness preclude achieving stringent mitigation futures (Rogelj et al. 2018 b). The risk of failure increases markedly in high-growth, unequal and/or energy-intensive worlds such as those characterised by the shared socio-economic pathways SSP3, SSP4 and SSP5. On the other hand, socio-economic development conducive to mitigation relieves the energy sector transformation from relying on large-scale technology development: for example, the amount of biomass with CCS in SSP1 is one third of that in SSP5. The reason why socio-economic trends matter so much is that they both affect the CO2 emissions in counterfactual scenarios as well as the mitigation capacity (Riahi et al. 2017; Rogelj et al. 2018 b). Economic growth assumptions are the most important determinant of scenario emissions (Marangoni et al. 2017). Degrowth and post-growth scenarios have been suggested as valuable alternatives to be considered (Hickel et al. 2021; Keyßer and Lenzen 2021), though substantial challenges remain regarding political feasibility (Keyßer and Lenzen 2021)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.1.6.1_p2,Biomass,"Burning fossil fuels to generate energy for buildings, transportation, industry, and other sectors is a major source of urban GHG emissions (Gurney et al. 2015). At the same time, most cities do not generate within their boundaries all of the resources they use, such as electricity, gasoline, cement, water, and food needed for local homes and businesses to function (Jacobs 1969), requiring consideration of GHG emissions embodied in supply chains serving cities. Furthermore, urban vegetation, soils, and aquatic systems can both emit or remove carbon from the urban atmosphere and are often heavily managed. For example, urban parks, forests, and street trees actively remove carbon from the atmosphere through growing season photosynthesis. They can become a net source of carbon most often during the dormant season or heat waves. Some of the sequestered carbon can be stored in the biomass of urban trees, soils, and aquatic systems. Urban infrastructures containing cement also uptake carbon through the process of carbonation. The uptake of carbon by urban trees is at least two orders of magnitude faster than by cement-containing infrastructures (Churkina 2012) (Section 8.4.4 and Figures 8.17 and 8.18)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.2.1_p8,Biomass;radiative forcing,"Cities in India, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand show that reducing emissions from major sources (e.g., transport, residential burning, biomass open burning, and industry) could bring substantial co-benefits of avoided deaths from reduced PM2.5 (fine inhalable particulates) emissions and radiative forcing from black carbon (Pathak and Shukla 2016; Dhar et al. 2017; Permadi et al. 2017; Karlsson et al. 2020), reduced noise, and reduced traffic injuries (Kwan and Hashim 2016). Compact city policies and interventions that support a modal shift away from private motor vehicles towards walking, cycling, and low-emission public transport delivers significant public health benefits (Creutzig 2016; Ürge-Vorsatz et al. 2018). Trade-offs associated with compact development include the marginal health costs of transport air pollution (Lohrey and Creutzig 2016) and stress from traffic noise (Gruebner et al. 2017) (Section 8.4.2.3)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.4.3.2_p3,Biomass,"A broad-based substitution of monolithic engineered timber systems for steel and concrete in mid-rise urban buildings offers the opportunity to transform cityscapes from their current status as net sources of GHG emissions into large-scale, human-made carbon sinks. The storage of photosynthetic forest carbon through the substitution of biomass-based structural materials for emissions-intensive steel and concrete is an opportunity for urban infrastructure. The construction of timber buildings for 2.3 billion new urban dwellers from 2020 to 2050 could store between 0.01 and 0.68 GtCO2 per year depending on the scenario and the average floor area per capita. Over 30 years, wood-based construction can accumulate between 0.25 and 20 GtCO2 and reduce cumulative emissions from 4 GtCO2 (range of 7–20 GtCO2) to 2 GtCO2 (range of 0.3–10 GtCO2) ( high confidence) (Churkina et al. 2020)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.4.3.2_p6,Biomass,"Transitioning to biomass-based building materials, implemented through the adoption of engineered structural timber products and assemblies, will succeed as a mitigation strategy only if working forests are managed and harvested sustainably (Churkina et al. 2020). Since future urban growth and the construction of timber cities may lead to increased timber demand in regions with low forest cover, it is necessary to systematically analyse timber demand, supply, trade, and potential competition for agricultural land in different regions (Pomponi et al. 2020). The widespread adoption of biomass-based urban construction materials and techniques will demand more robust forest and urban land governance and management policies, as well as internationally standardised carbon accounting methods to properly value and incentivise forest restoration, afforestation, and sustainable silviculture."

Based on estimates in New York City, it is likely that the majority of tree biomass, and carbon in trees in cities, could be found in urban natural area forest patches (medium agreement , limited evidence). More research is needed to map urban natural areas, assess vegetation, and differentiate tree canopy types (natural versus non-natural) at fine scales within many cities and geographies. Accurate maps, as well as greater understanding of definitions of urban canopies and vegetation, could lead to better accounts for carbon stocks and the many other unique benefits they provide (Raciti et al. 2012; Pregitzer et al. 2019a)."

cleaned_content/wg1/Chapter03#3.2.1_p1,anthropogenic,"Regression-based methods, also known as fingerprinting methods, have been widely used for detection of climate change and attribution of the change to different external drivers. Initially, these methods were applied to detect changes in global surface temperature, and were then extended to other climate variables at different time and spatial scales (e.g., Hegerl et al., 1996; Hasselmann, 1997; Allen and Tett, 1999; Gillett et al., 2003b; Zhang et al., 2007; Min et al., 2008a, 2011). These approaches are based on multivariate linear regression and assume that the observed change consists of a linear combination of externally forced signals plus internal variability, which generally holds for large-scale variables (Hegerl and Zwiers, 2011). The regressors are the expected space–time response patterns to different climate forcings (fingerprints), and the residuals represent internal variability. Fingerprints are usually estimated from climate model simulations following spatial and temporal averaging. A regression coefficient which is significantly greater than zero implies that a detectable change is identified in the observations. When the confidence interval of the regression coefficient includes unity and is inconsistent with zero, the magnitude of the model simulated fingerprints is assessed to be consistent with the observations, implying that the observed changes can be attributed in part to a particular forcing. Variants of linear regression have been used to address uncertainty in the fingerprints due to internal variability (Allen and Stott, 2003) as well as structural model uncertainty (Huntingford et al., 2006)."

This type of robust evidence exists for some key ecosystem services (Section 2.5.3, 2.5.4), and is assessed in specific report sections: biodiversity habitat creation and maintenance (Sections 2.4, 2.5), regulation of detrimental organisms and biological processes (Sections 2.4.2.3, 2.4.2.7, 2.4.4, 2.5.3, 2.6.4, Cross-Chapter Box ILLNESS in this chapter), regulation of climate through ecosystem feedbacks in terms of carbon storage (Sections 2.4.4.4, 2.5.2.10, 2.5.3.4, 2.5.3.5) and albedo (Section 2.5.3.5) and the provision of freshwater from ecosystems to people (Section 2.5.3.6)."

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.3.3.2 _p1,anthropogenic,"Depending on how the intensification of the global water cycle affects individual lake water budgets, the amount of water stored in specific lakes may increase, decrease or have no substantial cumulative effect (Notaro et al., 2015; Pekel et al., 2016; Rodell et al., 2018; Busker et al., 2019; Woolway et al., 2020b). The magnitude of hydrological changes that can be assuredly attributed to climate change remains uncertain (Hegerl et al., 2015; Gronewold and Rood, 2019; Kraemer et al., 2020). Attribution of water storage variation in lakes due to climate change is facilitated when such variations occur coherently across broad geographic regions and long time scales, preferably absent of other anthropogenic hydrological influences (Watras et al., 2014; Kraemer et al., 2020). There is increasing awareness that climate change contributes to the loss of small temporary ponds which cover a greater global area than lakes (Bagella et al., 2016)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.2.7.3_p1,anthropogenic,"Anthropogenic impacts, such as disturbances caused by climate change, can reduce biodiversity via multiple mechanisms and increase the risk of human diseases (limited evidence, low agreement ),  but more research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms (Civitello et al., 2015; Young et al., 2017b; Halliday et al., 2020; Rohr et al., 2020; Glidden et al., 2021). Known wildlife hosts of human-shared pathogens and parasites overall comprise a greater proportion of local species richness (18–72% higher) and abundance (21–144% higher) at sites under substantial human use (agricultural and urban land) compared with nearby undisturbed habitats (Gibb et al., 2020)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.3.2.1_p1,anthropogenic;anthropogenic climate change,"AR5 and a meta-analysis found that vegetation at the biome level shifted poleward latitudinally and upward altitudinally due to anthropogenic climate change in at least 19 sites in boreal, temperate and tropical ecosystems from 1700 to 2007 (Gonzalez et al., 2010; Settele et al., 2014). In these areas, temperature increased to 0.4°C–1.6°C above the pre-industrial period (Gonzalez et al., 2010; Settele et al., 2014). Field research since the AR5 detected additional poleward and upslope biome shifts over periods of 24–210 years at numerous sites (described below), but were not directly attributed to anthropogenic climate change as the studies were not designed or conducted properly for full attribution assessment."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.3.2.1_p2,anthropogenic,"Many of the recently detected shifts are nevertheless consistent with climate change-induced temperature increases and observed in areas without agriculture, livestock grazing, timber harvesting and other anthropogenic land uses. For example, in the Andes Mountains in Ecuador, a biome shift was detected by comparing a survey by Alexander von Humboldt in 1802 to a re-survey in 2012, making this the longest time span in the world for this type of data (Morueta-Holme et al., 2015; Moret et al., 2019). Over 210 years, temperature increased by 1.7°C (Morueta-Holme et al., 2015) and the upper edge of alpine grassland shifted 100–450 m upslope (Moret et al., 2019)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.3.2.1_p4,anthropogenic;anthropogenic climate change,"In summary, anthropogenic climate change caused latitudinal and elevational biome shifts in at least 19 sites in boreal, temperate and tropical ecosystems between 1700 and 2007, where temperature increased to 0.4°C–1.6°C above the pre-industrial period (robust evidence, high agreement ). Additional cases of 5–20 km northward and 20–300 m upslope biome shifts between 1860 and 2016, under a mean global temperature increase of approximately 0.9°C above the pre-industrial period, are consistent with climate change (medium evidence, high agreement )."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.3.3_p1,anthropogenic;anthropogenic climate change;invasive species,"Divergent responses to anthropogenic climate change are occurring within and across arid regions, depending on time period, location, detection methodology and vegetation type (see Cross-Chapter Paper 3). Emerging shifts in ecosystem structure, functioning and biodiversity are supported by evidence from modelled impacts of projected climate and CO2 levels. While observed responsiveness of arid vegetation productivity to rising atmospheric CO2 (Fensholt et al., 2012) may offset risks from reduced water availability (Fang et al., 2017), climate- and CO2-driven changes are key risks in arid regions, interacting with habitat degradation, wildfires and invasive species (Hurlbert et al., 2019)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.3.7_p1,anthropogenic;anthropogenic climate change;phenology,"The AR5 found increased tree mortality, wildfire and plant phenology changes in boreal and temperate forests (Settele et al., 2014). Expanding on these conclusions, this assessment, using analyses of causal factors, attributes the following observed changes in boreal and temperate forests in the 20th and 21st centuries to anthropogenic climate change: upslope and poleward biome shifts at sites in Asia, Europe and North America (Section 2.4.3.2.1); range shifts of plants (Section 2.4.2.1); earlier blooming and leafing of plants (Section 2.4.2.4); poleward shifts in tree-feeding insects (Section 2.4.2.1); increases in insect pest outbreaks (Section 2.4.4.3.3); increases in the area burned by wildfire in western North America (Section 2.4.4.2.1); increased drought-induced tree mortality in western North America (Section 2.4.4.3.1); and thawing of the permafrost that underlies extensive areas of boreal forest (Section 2.4.3.9)(Section 2.3.2.5 in (Gulev et al., 2021)). Atmospheric CO2 from anthropogenic sources has also increased net primary productivity (NPP) (Section 2.4.4.5.1). In summary, anthropogenic climate change has caused substantial changes in temperate and boreal forest ecosystems, including biome shifts and increases in wildfire, insect pest outbreaks and tree mortality, at a global mean surface temperature (GMST) increase of 0.9°C above the pre-industrial period (robust evidence, high agreement )."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.3.8_p1,anthropogenic;carbon cycle;weather;ecosystem services,"Globally, peatland ecosystems store approximately 25% (600 ± 100 GtC) of the world’s soil organic carbon (Yu et al., 2010; Page et al., 2011; Hugelius et al., 2020) and 10% of the world’s freshwater resources (Joosten and Clarke, 2002), despite only occupying 3% of the global land area (Xu et al., 2018a). The long-term role of northern peatlands in the carbon cycle was mentioned for the first time in IPCC AR4 (IPCC, 2007), while SR1.5 briefly mentioned the combined effects of changes in climate and land use on peatlands (IPCC, 2018b). New evidence confirms that climate change, including extreme weather events (e.g., droughts; Section 8.3.1.6), permafrost degradation (Section 2.3.2.5), SLR (Section 2.3.3.3) and fire (Section 5.4.3.2) (Henman and Poulter, 2008; Kirwan and Mudd, 2012; Turetsky et al., 2015; Page and Hooijer, 2016; Swindles et al., 2019; Hoyt et al., 2020; Hugelius et al., 2020; Jovani-Sancho et al., 2021; Veraverbeke et al., 2021), superimposed on anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., draining for agriculture or mining; Section 5.2.1.1), has led to rapid losses of peatland carbon across the world (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Page et al., 2011; Leifeld et al., 2019; Hoyt et al., 2020; Turetsky et al., 2020; Loisel et al., 2021). Other essential peatland ecosystem services, such as water storage and biodiversity, are also being lost worldwide (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Bonn et al., 2014; Martin-Ortega et al., 2014; Tiemeyer et al., 2017)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.3.8_p3,anthropogenic;carbon sink,"In large, lowland tropical peatland basins that are less impacted by anthropogenic activities (i.e., the Amazon and Congo river basins), the direct impact of climate change is that of a decreased carbon sink (limited evidence, medium agreement ) (Roucoux et al., 2013; Gallego-Sala et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018a; Dargie et al., 2019; Ribeiro et al., 2021). As for the temperate and boreal regions, climatic drying also tends to promote peat oxidation and carbon loss to the atmosphere (medium evidence, medium agreement ) (Section 2.3.1.3.4) (Helbig et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). In Europe, increasing mean annual temperatures in the Baltic, Scandinavia, and continental Europe (Section 12.4.5.1) have led to widespread lowering of peatland water tables at intact sites (Swindles et al., 2019), desiccation and die-off of sphagnum moss (Bragazza, 2008; Lees et al., 2019) and increased intensity and frequency of fires, resulting in a rapid carbon loss (Davies et al., 2013; Veraverbeke et al., 2021). Nevertheless, longer growing seasons and warmer, wetter climates have increased carbon accumulation and promoted thick deposits regionally, as reported for some North American sites (limited evidence, medium agreement ) (Cai and Yu, 2011; Shiller et al., 2014; Ott and Chimner, 2016)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.3.8_p5,anthropogenic;Deforestation;feedback,"The CO2 emissions from degrading peatlands is contributing to climate change in a positive feedback loop (robust evidence, high agreement). At mid-latitudes, widespread anthropogenic disturbance led to large historical GHG emissions and current legacy emissions of 0.15 PgC yr -1 between 1990 and 2000 (limited evidence, high agreement ) (Maljanen et al., 2010; Tiemeyer et al., 2016; Drexler et al., 2018; Qiu et al., 2021). About 80 million hectares of peatland have been converted to agriculture, equivalent to 72 PgC emissions in 850–2010 CE (Leifeld et al., 2019; Qiu et al., 2021). In Southeast Asia (SEA), an estimated 20–25 Mha of peatlands have been converted to agriculture with carbon currently being lost at a rate of ~155 ± 30 MtC yr −1 (Miettinen et al., 2016; Leifeld et al., 2019; Hoyt et al., 2020). Extensive deforestation and drainage have caused widespread peat subsidence and large CO2 emissions at a current average of ~10 ± 2 tonnes ha -1 yr -1, excluding fires (Hoyt et al., 2020), with values estimated from point subsidence measurements being as high as 30–90 tonnes CO2 ha −1 yr −1 locally (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Wösten et al., 1997; Matysek et al., 2018; Swails et al., 2018; Evans et al., 2019; Conchedda and Tubiello, 2020; Anshari et al., 2021). On average, at the global scale, increases in GHG emissions from peatlands have primarily come from the compounded effects of LUC, drought and fire, with additional emissions from some thawing-permafrost peatlands (robust evidence, high agreement )."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.4.2.1_p2,anthropogenic;anthropogenic climate change,"Since the AR5 and the IPCC Special Report on Land, published research has detected increases in the area burned by wildfire, analysed relative contributions of climate and non-climate factors and attributed burned area increases above natural (recent historical) levels to anthropogenic climate change in one part of the world, western North America (robust evidence, high agreement)  (Abatzoglou and Williams, 2016; Partain et al., 2016; Kirchmeier-Young et al., 2019; Mansuy et al., 2019; Bowman et al., 2020). Across the western USA, increases in vegetation aridity due to higher temperatures from anthropogenic climate change doubled burned area from 1984 to 2015 over what would have burned due to non-climate factors including unnatural fuel accumulation from fire suppression, with the burned area attributed to climate change accounting for 49% (32–76%, 95% confidence interval) of cumulative burned area (Abatzoglou and Williams, 2016). Anthropogenic climate change doubled the severity of a southwest North American drought from 2000 to 2020 that has reduced soil moisture to its lowest levels since the 1500s (Williams et al., 2020), driving half of the increase in burned area (Abatzoglou and Williams, 2016; Holden et al., 2018; Williams et al., 2019). In British Columbia, Canada, the increased maximum temperatures due to anthropogenic climate change increased burned area in 2017 to its highest extent in the 1950–2017 record, seven to eleven times the area that would have burned without climate change (Kirchmeier-Young et al., 2019). In Alaska, USA, the high maximum temperatures and extremely low relative humidity due to anthropogenic climate change accounted for 33–60% of the probability of wildfire in 2015, when the area burned was the second highest in the 1940–2015 record (Partain et al., 2016). In protected areas of Canada and the USA, climate factors (temperature, precipitation, relative humidity and evapotranspiration) accounted for 60% of burned area from local human and natural ignitions from 1984 to 2014, outweighing local human factors (population density, roads and built area) (Mansuy et al., 2019)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.4.2.1_p3,anthropogenic;anthropogenic climate change,"In summary, field evidence shows that anthropogenic climate change has increased the area burned by wildfire above natural levels across western North America in the period 1984–2017, at GMST increases of 0.6°C–0.9°C, increasing burned area up to 11 times in one extreme year and doubling it (over natural levels) in a 32-year period (high confidence)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.4.2.3_p1,anthropogenic;anthropogenic climate change,"While burned area has increased in parts of Asia, Australia, Europe and South America, published research has not yet attributed the increases to anthropogenic climate change (medium evidence, high agreement )."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.4.2.3_p3,anthropogenic;weather;anthropogenic climate change,"In Australia, burned area increased significantly between the periods 1950–2002 and 2003–2020 in the southeast state of Victoria, with the area burned in the 2019–2020 bushfires being the highest on record (Lindenmayer and Taylor, 2020). In addition to the deaths of dozens of people and the destruction of thousands of houses, the 2019–2020 bushfires burned almost half of the area protected for conservation in Victoria, two-thirds of the forests allocated for timber harvesting (Lindenmayer and Taylor, 2020), wildlife and extensive areas of habitat for threatened plant and animal species (Geary et al., 2021). Generally, past timber harvesting did not lead to more severe fire canopy damage (Bowman et al., 2021b). Across southeastern Australia, the fraction of vegetated area that burned increased significantly in eight of the 32 bioregions from 1975 to 2009, but decreased significantly in three bioregions (Bradstock et al., 2014). Increases in four bioregions were correlated to increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation. Decreases in burned area occurred despite increased temperature and decreased precipitation. Analyses of climate across Australia from 1950 to 2017 (Dowdy, 2018; Harris and Lucas, 2019) and during periods with extensive fires in 2017 in eastern Australia (Hope et al., 2019), in 2018 in northeastern Australia (Lewis et al., 2020), and in period 2019–2020 in southeastern Australia (Abram et al., 2021; van Oldenborgh et al., 2021) indicate that temperature and drought extremes due to the ENSO, Southern Annular Mode and other natural inter-decadal cycles drive inter-annual variability of fire weather. While the effects of inter-decadal climate cycles on fire are superimposed on long-term climate change, the relative importance of anthropogenic climate change in explaining changes in burned area in Australia remains unquantified (medium evidence, high agreement )."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.4.2.3_p9,anthropogenic;Deforestation;anthropogenic climate change,"Overall, burned area has increased in the Amazon, Arctic, Australia and parts of Africa and Asia, consistent with, but not formally attributed to anthropogenic climate change (medium evidence, high agreement ). Deforestation, peat draining, agricultural expansion or abandonment, fire suppression and inter-decadal cycles such as the ENSO exert a stronger influence than climate change on wildfire trends in numerous regions outside of North America (high confidence)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.4.2.4_p1,anthropogenic;weather;anthropogenic climate change,"The IPCC AR6 WGI assessed fire weather (Ranasinghe et al., 2021), while this chapter assesses the impacts of changes in fire weather: burned area and fire frequency. The global increases in temperature from anthropogenic climate change have increased aridity and drought, lengthening the fire weather season (the annual period with a heat and aridity index greater than half of its annual range) on one-quarter of global vegetated area and increasing the average fire season length by one-fifth from 1979 to 2013 (Jolly et al., 2015). Climate change has contributed to increases in the fire weather season or the probability of fire weather conditions in the Amazon (Jolly et al., 2015), Australia (Dowdy, 2018; Abram et al., 2021; van Oldenborgh et al., 2021), Canada (Hanes et al., 2019), central Asia (Jolly et al., 2015), East Africa (Jolly et al., 2015) and North America (Jain et al., 2017; Williams et al., 2019; Goss et al., 2020). In forest areas, the burned area correlates with fuel aridity, a function of temperature; in non-forest areas, the burned area correlates with high precipitation in the previous year, which can produce high grass fuel loads (Abatzoglou et al., 2018). Fire use in agriculture and raising livestock or other factors have generated a second fire season on approximately one-quarter of global land where fire is present, despite sub-optimal fire weather in the second fire season (Benali et al., 2017). In summary, anthropogenic climate change, through a 0.9°C surface temperature increase since the pre-industrial period, has lengthened or increased the frequency of periods with heat and aridity that favour wildfire on up to one-quarter of vegetated area since 1979 (robust evidence, high agreement )."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.4.2.5_p1,anthropogenic;anthropogenic climate change,"Globally, fire has contributed to biome shifts (Section 2.4.3.2) and tree mortality (Sections 2.4.4.2, 2.4.4.3) attributed to anthropogenic climate change. Research since the AR5 has also found vegetation changes from wildfire due to climate change. Through increased temperature and aridity, anthropogenic climate change has driven post-fire changes in plant regeneration and species composition in South Africa (Slingsby et al., 2017), and tree regeneration in the western USA (Davis et al., 2019b). In the fynbos vegetation of the Cape Floristic Region, South Africa, post-fire heat and drought and the legacy effects of exotic plant species reduced the regeneration of native plant species, decreasing species richness by 12% from 1966 to 2010 and shifting the average temperature tolerance of species communities upward by 0.5°C (Slingsby et al., 2017). In burned areas across the western USA, the increasing heat and aridity of anthropogenic climate change from 1979 to 2015 pushed low-elevation ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests across critical thresholds of heat and aridity that reduced the post-fire tree regeneration by half (Davis et al., 2019b). In the southwestern USA, where anthropogenic climate change has caused drought (Williams et al., 2019) and increased wildfire (Abatzoglou and Williams, 2016), high-severity fires have converted some forest patches to shrublands (Barton and Poulos, 2018). Field evidence shows that anthropogenic climate change and wildfire, together, altered vegetation species composition in the southwestern USA and Cape floristic region, South Africa, reducing post-fire natural regeneration and species richness of tree and other plant species, between 1966 and 2015, at GMST increases of 0.3°C–0.9°C (medium evidence, high agreement )."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.4.3.1_p1,anthropogenic;anthropogenic climate change,"Anthropogenic climate change can cause tree mortality directly via increased aridity or drought (Section 2.4.4.3.3) or indirectly through wildfire (Section 2.4.4.2.1) and insect pests (Section 2.4.4.3.3). Catastrophic failure of the plant hydraulic system, in which a lack of water causes the xylem to lose hydraulic conductance, is the principal mechanism of drought-induced tree death (Anderegg et al., 2016; Adams et al., 2017; Anderegg et al., 2018; Choat et al., 2018; Menezes-Silva et al., 2019; Brodribb et al., 2020)."

Increased wildfire and pest infestations, driven by climate change, also contributed to North American tree mortality (van Mantgem et al., 2009). In addition, a meta-analysis of published cases found that drought consistent with, but not formally attributed to, climate change had caused tree mortality at 88 sites in boreal, temperate and tropical ecosystems (Allen et al., 2010), with 49 additional cases found by the AR5 (Settele et al., 2014)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.4.3.1_p4,anthropogenic;anthropogenic climate change,"In summary, anthropogenic climate change caused drought-induced tree mortality of up to 20% in the period 1945–2007 in western North America, the African Sahel and North Africa, via global temperature increases of 0.3°C–0.9°C above the pre-industrial period and increases in aridity, and it contributed to over 100 other cases of drought-induced tree mortality in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe and North and South America (high confidence). Field observations document accelerating mortality rates, rising background mortality and post-mortality vegetation shifts (high confidence). Water stress, leading to plant hydraulic failure, is the principal mechanism of drought-induced tree mortality. Timber cutting, agricultural expansion, air pollution and other non-climate factors also contribute to tree death."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.4.3.3_p1,anthropogenic;anthropogenic climate change,"The most extensive research into tree mortality since the AR5 has been in the western USA, where anthropogenic climate change accounted for half the magnitude of a drought in the period 2000–2020 that has been the most severe since the 1500s, (Williams et al., 2020) and for one-tenth to one-quarter of the magnitude of the 2012–2014 period of th e severe drought in California that lasted from 2012 to 2016 (Williams et al., 2015a). Across the western USA, anthropogenic climate change doubled tree mortality between 1955 and 2007 (van Mantgem et al., 2009). Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) mortality increased 700% from 2000 to 2013 (Anderegg et al., 2015) and piñon pine (P. edulis) experienced >50% mortality from 2002 to 2014 (Redmond et al., 2018). In montane conifer forest in California, anthropogenic climate change has increased tree mortality by one-quarter (Goulden and Bales, 2019). One-quarter of the trees died in some areas, with mortality rates of ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa) and sugar pine (P. lambertiana) increasing to up to 700% of pre-drought rates (Stephenson et al., 2019; Stovall et al., 2019). Substantial field evidence shows that anthropogenic climate change has caused extensive tree mortality in North America (robust evidence, high agreement )."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.4.4.1_p2,anthropogenic;Deforestation;anthropogenic climate change,"Deforestation, draining of peatlands and the expansion of agricultural fields, livestock pastures and human settlements and other LULCCs emitted carbon at a rate of 1.6 ± 0.7 Gt yr -1 from 2010 to 2019, (Friedlingstein et al., 2020), of which wildfires and peat burning emitted 0.4 ± 0.2 Gt yr -1 from 1997 to 2016 (van der Werf et al., 2017). Anthropogenic climate change has caused some of these emissions through increases in wildfire (Section 2.4.4.2.1) and tree mortality (Section 2.4.4.3.1), but the fraction of the total remains unquantified. LUC produced ~15% of global anthropogenic emissions, from fossil fuels and land (Friedlingstein et al., 2020). Terrestrial ecosystems removed carbon from the atmosphere through plant growth at a rate of -3.4 ± 0.9 Gt yr -1 from 2010 to 2019 (Friedlingstein et al., 2020)."

In California, USA, two-thirds of the 70 MtC emitted from natural ecosystems in 2001–2010 came from the 6% of the area that burned (Gonzalez et al., 2015). Anthropogenic climate change caused up to half of the burned area (Section 2.4.4.2.1)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.4.4.4_p6,anthropogenic;anthropogenic climate change,"In the Arctic, anthropogenic climate change has thawed permafrost (Guo et al., 2020), leading to emissions of 1.7 ± 0.8 GtC yr -1 in winter in the period 2003–2017 (Natali et al., 2019). Wildfires in the Arctic tundra in Alaska from ~1930 to 2010 caused up to a depth of 0.5 m of permafrost thaw (Brown et al., 2015), exposing peatland carbon (Brown et al., 2015; Gibson et al., 2018) including soil carbon deposits up to 1600 years old (Walker et al., 2019)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.5_p4,anthropogenic;weather;anthropogenic climate change,"Responses in freshwater species are consistent with responses in terrestrial species, including poleward and upward range shifts, earlier timing of spring plankton development, earlier spawning by fish and the extension of the growing season  (high confidence). Observed changes in freshwater species are strongly related to anthropogenic climate change-driven changes in the physical environment (e.g., increased water temperature, reduced ice cover, reduced mixing in lakes, loss of oxygen and reduced river connectivity) (high confidence). While evidence is robust  for an increase in primary production in nutrient rich lakes along with warming trends (high confidence), increasing or declining algal formations are lake-specific and are modulated through variability in weather conditions, lake morphology, changes in salinity, stoichiometry, land use and restoration measures and food web interactions. In boreal coniferous forest, there has been an increase in terrestrial-derived DOM transported into rivers and lakes as a consequence of climate change (which has induced increases in runoff and greening of the Northern Hemisphere) as well as from changes in forestry practices. This has caused waters to become brown, resulting in an acceleration of upper-water warming and an overall cooling of deep water (high confidence). Browning may accelerate primary production through the input of nutrients associated with DOM in nutrient-poor lakes and increases the growth of cyanobacteria, which cope better with low light intensity (medium confidence) (Sections 2.4.2.1, 2.4.2.2, 2.4.2.3, 2.4.2.4)."

Globally, woody encroachment into open areas (grasslands, arid regions and tundra) is likely  being driven by climate change and increased CO2, in concert with changes in grazing and fire regimes (medium confidence) (Section 2.4.3)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.5_p6,anthropogenic;anthropogenic climate change,"Climate change has driven, or is contributing to, increased tree mortality directly through increased aridity and droughts and indirectly through increased wildfires and insect pests in many locations (high confidence). Analyses of causal factors have attributed increasing tree mortality at sites in Africa and North America to anthropogenic climate change, and field evidence has detected tree mortality due to drought, wildfires and insect pests in temperate and tropical forests around the world (high confidence). Water stress, leading to plant hydraulic failure, is a principal mechanism of drought-induced tree mortality, along with the indirect effects of climate change mediated by community interactions (high confidence) (Section 2.4.4.3)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.5_p8,anthropogenic;Deforestation;anthropogenic climate change,"Globally, increases in temperature, aridity and drought have increased the length of fire seasons and doubled the potentially burnable land area (medium confidence). Increases in the area burned have been attributed to anthropogenic climate change in North America (high confidence). In parts of Africa, Asia, Australia and South America, the area burned has also increased, consistent with anthropogenic climate change. Deforestation, peat-burning, agricultural expansion or abandonment, fire suppression and inter-decadal cycles strongly influence fire occurrence. The areas with the greatest increases in the length of the fire season include the Amazon, western North America, western Asia and East Africa (Section 2.4.4.2)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.2.7_p2,anthropogenic,"Reforestation, either natural or anthropogenic, leads to summer cooling and winter warming of the ground, while forest thinning or removal by fire has reverse effects, deepening the upper layer that is free of permafrost (Stuenzi et al., 2021a). Interactions between permafrost and vegetation are important. For example, trees in the east Siberian taiga obtained water mostly from rain in wet summers and permafrost melt water in dry summers (Sugimoto et al., 2002), suggesting that these forests will be particularly vulnerable to the combination of drought with the retraction of permafrost further underground due to climate warming."

This IPCC chapter assesses these as the most fundamental risks of climate change to ecosystem integrity and the ecosystem services that support human well-being. Climate factors include the primary variables governing the risk. Non-climate factors include other phenomena that can dominate or contribute to the risk. Detection and attribution comprise cases of observed changes attributed predominantly, or in part, to climate change, with some cases being attributed to anthropogenic climate change (Sections 2.4.2, 2.4.3, 2.4.4, 2.4.5, Table 2.2, Table 2.3, Table SM2.1). Adaptation includes options to address the risk (Section 2.6). Risk transitions (defined in Figure 2.11) indicate an approximate GSAT increase, relative to the pre-industrial period (1850–1900), to move from one level of risk to the other as well as assessed confidence. Table SM2.5 provides details of the temperature levels for risk transitions. Both tables provides details for the key risk burning embers diagram (Figure 2.11)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.4_p1,anthropogenic;invasive species,"Low-probability events can have a very high impact (e.g., the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from wild animals to humans, causing the Covid-19 pandemic ). A robust disease risk reduction policy would include utilising One Biosecurity (Meyerson and Reaser, 2002; Hulme, 2020; MacLeod and Spence, 2020) or One Health (Monath et al., 2010; Deem et al., 2018; Destoumieux-Garzón et al., 2018; Zinsstag et al., 2018) approaches with actions to reduce disease risk across multiple sectors and from a variety of anthropogenic drivers, including climate change, even if there is high uncertainty in projected risk (see Cross-Chapter Boxes ILLNESS in this chapter, COVID in Chapter 7 and DEEP in Chapter 17). Kraemer et al. (2019) found that vector importation was a key risk factor and that the focus should be on preventing the introduction of invasive species. Furthermore, many neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are also VBDs, and the UN SDG of good health and well-being explicitly calls for increased control and intervention with a focus on emergency preparedness and response (Stensgaard et al., 2019a)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.5.6_p3,anthropogenic;anthropogenic climate change,"Joshua Tree National Park conserves 3200 km 2 of the Mojave and Sonoran Desert ecosystems. The climate of the national park is arid, with an average summer temperature of 27.3°C ± 0.7°C and average annual precipitation of 170 ± 80 mm yr -1 in the period 1971–2000 (Gonzalez et al., 2018). From 1895 to 2017, the average annual temperature increased at a significant (P < 0.0001) rate of 1.5°C ± 0.1°C per century and the average annual precipitation decreased at a significant (P = 0.0174) rate of -32 ± 12% per century (Gonzalez et al., 2018). Anthropogenic climate change accounts for half the magnitude of a 2000–2020 drought in the southwestern USA, the most severe since the 1500s (Williams et al., 2020)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.7.1_p1,anthropogenic;anthropogenic climate change;detection and attribution,"Detection and attribution efforts have increased since AR5, but there are some key impacts of high societal importance that would benefit from more detailed and sophisticated attribution studies. For example, while it is clear that diseases have altered considerably in both wild animals and humans in some areas (high confidence in detection), there are many regions that are under-studied, and few regions that provide robust assessments of the role of climate change, particularly with respect to human infectious diseases. While wildfire has been robustly linked to climate change in some regions, there are still a lack of attribution studies in some regions that have experienced large burns recently, and only one fire impact—the increase of the area burned by wildfire in western North America in the period 1984–2017 (Section 2.4.4.2.1) —has been formally attributed to anthropogenic climate change. Global changes in soil and freshwater ecosystem carbon over time remain uncertainties in global carbon stocks and changes (Section 2.4.4.4); due to the physical inability to conduct repeat-monitoring and the lack of remote sensing to scale up point measurements, no global methods can yet produce repeating spatial estimates of soil carbon stock changes."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.3.8.4_p7,anthropogenic,"Fire has been found to promote or halt biological invasions (medium confidence: medium evidence, high agreement ). For example, an analysis of Pinus spread following wildfires in Patagonia revealed a high risk that pines will become invasive if ignition frequency increases as a result of climate change (Raffaele et al., 2016). According to Inostroza et al. (2016), the Magellan Region is one of the most fragile regions in Patagonia, and despite its low population densities, it is undergoing a silent process of anthropogenic alteration where between 53.1% and 68.1% of the area needs to be considered to be influenced by humans who are occupying pristine ecosystems, even some with extensive conservation designations (Inostroza et al., 2016). Fire exposure can result in several health problems for human populations; Table 12.5 shows that SSA is the region with the highest exposure to wildfire danger."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.6.2_p1,anthropogenic,"Amazonian dark earths (ADEs), also known as Terras Pretas de Índio, are anthropogenic soils derived from the activities associated with the settlements and agricultural practices of pre-Hispanic societies in the Amazon (Woods and McCann, 1999; Lehmann et al., 2003; Sombroek et al., 2003). Most of the ADEs identified so far are 500 to 2500 years old (de Souza et al., 2019). According to Maezumi et al. (2018a), polyculture agroforestry allowed for the development of complex societies in the eastern Amazon around 4500 years ago. Agroforestry was combined with the cultivation of multiple crops and the active and progressive increase in the proportion of edible plant species in the forest, along with hunting and fishing. The formation of ADEs as a result of these activities served as the basis for a food production system that supported a growing human population in the area (Maezumi et al., 2018a)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.6.2_p4,anthropogenic;carbon sink;anthropogenic climate change,"There is a robust and growing body of research from various disciplines that assigns a high relevance to ADEs in the region. It has been shown through archaeological and palaeoclimatic data that Amazonian societies that based their agricultural management on Terras Pretas de Índio were more resilient to the changing climate due to increased soil fertility and water retention capacity (de Souza et al., 2019). Additionally, low organic carbon degradability over long time periods, associated with high contents of charcoal or pyrogenic carbon, makes these soils an important C sink (medium confidence: robust evidence, medium agreement ) (Lehmann et al., 2003; Guo, 2016; Trujillo et al., 2020), which is particularly relevant in an area like the Amazon, that could change from a net carbon sink to a net carbon source as a consequence of anthropogenic climate change (Maezumi et al., 2018b)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.6.2_p6,anthropogenic;carbon sequestration,"At present, ADEs are estimated to cover up to 3.2% of the Amazon basin and are highly valued for their persistent fertility, and they have become a key resource for sustainable agriculture for Amazon communities in a climate-change context (Altieri and Nicholls, 2013; Maezumi et al., 2018a; de Souza et al., 2019). Based on the lessons learned from the Terras Pretas de Índio, some researchers have proposed the development of technologies to promote a new generation of anthropogenic soils (e.g., Kern et al. 2009; Lehmann 2009; Schmidt et al. 2014; Bezerra et al. 2016; Kern et al. 2019). Among the technologies based on ADE findings, biochar, obtained by the slow pyrolysis of agricultural residues, is the most explored application found in the literature (Mohan et al., 2018; Matoso et al., 2019; Amoah-Antwi et al., 2020). The dual purpose of increased soil fertility and carbon sequestration is considered an important goal in connection with developing sustainable agriculture in a climate-change context (Kern et al., 2019)."

cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.2.1_p1,anthropogenic,"Scenario and emission pathways are used to explore possible long-term trajectories, the effectiveness of possible mitigation strategies, and to help understand key uncertainties about the future. Ascenario is an integrated description of a possible future of the human–environment system (Clarke et al. 2014), and could be a qualitative narrative, quantitative projection, or both. Scenarios typically capture interactions and processes that change key driving forces such as population, GDP, technology, lifestyles, and policy, and the consequences on energy use, land use, and emissions. Scenarios are not predictions or forecasts. An emission pathway is a modelled trajectory of anthropogenic emissions (Rogelj et al. 2018 a) and, therefore, a part of a scenario."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#cross-chapter-box-3_p21,anthropogenic,"Net zero CO2and carbon neutrality have different meanings in this assessment, as is the case for net zero GHG and GHG neutrality. They apply to different boundaries in the emissions and removals being considered. Net zero (GHG or CO2) refers to emissions and removals under the direct control or territorial responsibility of the reporting entity. In contrast, (GHG or carbon) neutrality includes anthropogenic emissions and anthropogenic removals within and also those beyond the direct control or territorial responsibility of the reporting entity. At the global scale, net zero CO2 and carbon neutrality are equivalent, as is the case for net zero GHG and GHG neutrality. The term ‘climate neutrality’ is not used in this assessment because the concept of climate neutrality is diffuse, used differently by different communities, and not readily quantified."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.4.6_p7,anthropogenic,"Anthropogenic land CO2 emissions and removals in IAM pathways cannot be directly compared with those reported in national GHG inventories ( high confidence) (Grassi et al. 2018, 2021) (Section 7.2). Due to differences in definitions for the area of managed forests and which emissions and removals are considered anthropogenic, the reported anthropogenic land CO2 emissions and removals differ by about 5.5 GtCO2 yr –1 between IAMs, which rely on bookkeeping approaches (e.g., Houghton and Nassikas 2017), and national GHG inventories (Grassi et al. 2021). Such differences in definitions can alter the reported time at which anthropogenic net zero CO2 emissions are reached for a given emission scenario. Using national inventories would lead to an earlier reported time of net zero (van Soest et al. 2021b) or to lower calculated cumulative emissions until the time of net zero (Grassi et al. 2021) as compared to IAM pathways. The numerical differences are purely due to differences in the conventions applied for reporting the anthropogenic emissions and do not have any implications for the underlying land-use changes or mitigation measures in the pathways. Grassi et al. (Grassi et al. 2021) offer a methodology for adjusting to reconcile these differences and enable a more accurate assessment of the collective progress achieved under the Paris Agreement (Chapter 7 and Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 7)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.1.6.1_p1,anthropogenic;carbon cycle;carbon sink,"In cities, carbon cycles through natural (e.g., vegetation and soils) and managed (e.g., reservoirs and anthropogenic – buildings, transportation) pools. The accumulation of carbon in urban pools, such as buildings or landfills, results from the local or global transfer of carbon-containing energy and raw materials used in the city (Churkina 2008; Pichler et al. 2017; Chen et al. 2020b). Quantitative understanding of these transfers and the resulting emissions and uptake within an urban area is essential for accurate urban carbon accounting (USGCRP 2018). Currently, urban areas are a net source of carbon because they emit more carbon than they uptake. Thus, urban mitigation strategies require a twofold strategy: reducing urban emissions of carbon into the atmosphere, and enhancing uptake of carbon in urban pools (Churkina 2012) (for a broader definition of ‘carbon cycle’ and related terms such as ‘carbon sink,’ ‘carbon stock,’ ‘carbon neutrality,’ ‘GHG neutrality,’ and others, see Glossary)."

Between 2000 and 2015, the global population in locations that were affected by floods grew by 58–86 million (Tellman et al. 2021). The direct economic costs of all extreme events reached USD210–268 billion in 2020 (Aon 2021; Munich RE 2021; WMO 2021) or about USD0.7 billion per day; this figure does not include knock-on costs in supply chains (Kii 2020) or lost days of work, implying that the actual economic costs could be far higher. Depending on RCP, between half (RCP2.6) and three-quarters (RCP8.5) of the global population could be exposed to periods of life-threatening climatic conditions arising from coupled impacts of extreme heat and humidity by 2100 (Mora et al. 2017; Huang et al. 2019) (see WGII Section 6.2.2.1, WGII Figure 6.3, and WGIII Sections 8.2 and 8.3.4)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.7.1_p4,anthropogenic,"Though preliminary, some studies suggest that urban areas saw larger overall declines in emissions because of lower commuter activity and associated emissions. For example, researchers have explored the COVID-19 impact in the cities of Los Angeles, Baltimore, Washington, DC, and San Francisco Bay Area in the United States. In the San Francisco region, a decline of 30% in anthropogenic CO2 was observed, which was primarily due to changes in on-road traffic (Turner et al. 2020). Declines in the Washington, DC/Baltimore region and in the Los Angeles urban area were 33% and 34%, respectively, in the month of April 2020 compared to previous years (Yadav et al. 2021)."

The latter of these developments is particularly significant for projections of ocean stressors as it directly affects the representation of stratification. Updates in the representation of ocean biogeochemical processes between CMIP5 and CMIP6 have typically involved an increase in model complexity. Specific developments have been the more widespread inclusion of micronutrients, such as iron, variable stoichiometric ratios, more detailed representation of lower trophic levels including bacteria and the cycling and sinking of organic matter. CMIP6 biogeochemical model performance is generally an improvement on that of the parent CMIP5 generation of models (Séférian et al., 2020). The global representation of present-day air-sea carbon fluxes and surface chlorophyll concentrations show moderate improvements between CMIP5 and CMIP6. Similar improvements are seen in the representation of subsurface oxygen concentrations in most ocean basins, while the representation of surface macronutrient concentrations in CMIP6 is shown to have improved with respect to silicic acid but declined slightly with respect to nitrate. Model representation of the micronutrient iron has not improved substantially since CMIP5, but many more models are capable of representing iron. In addition, a comparison of the carbon concentration and carbon climate feedbacks shows no significant change between CMIP5 and CMIP6 (Arora et al., 2020)."

cleaned_content/syr/longer-report#1. Introduction_p1,adaptation;climate change mitigation,"This Synthesis Report (SYR) of the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) summarises the state of knowledge of climate change, its widespread impacts and risks, and climate change mitigation and adaptation, based on the peer-reviewed scientific, technical and socio-economic literature since the publication of the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) in 2014."
cleaned_content/syr/longer-report#1. Introduction_p3,adaptation,"This report integrates the main findings of the AR6 Working Group reports 58  and the three AR6 Special Reports 59 . It recognizes the interdependence of climate, ecosystems and biodiversity, and human societies; the value of diverse forms of knowledge; and the close linkages between climate change adaptation, mitigation, ecosystem health, human well-being and sustainable development. Building on multiple analytical frameworks, including those from the physical and social sciences, this report identifies opportunities for transformative action which are effective, feasible, just and equitable using concepts of systems transitions and resilient development pathways 60 . Different regional classification schemes 61  are used for physical, social and economic aspects, reflecting the underlying literature."
cleaned_content/syr/longer-report#1. Introduction_p4,adaptation,"After this introduction, Section 2, ‘Current Status and Trends’, opens with the assessment of observational evidence for our changing climate, historical and current drivers of human-induced climate change, and its impacts. It assesses the current implementation of adaptation and mitigation response options. Section 3, ‘Long-Term Climate and Development Futures’, provides a long-term assessment of climate change to 2100 and beyond in a broad range of socio-economic futures. It considers long-term characteristics, impacts, risks and costs in adaptation and mitigation pathways in the context of sustainable development. Section 4, ‘Near- Term Responses in a Changing Climate’, assesses opportunities for scaling up effective action in the period up to 2040, in the context of climate pledges, and commitments, and the pursuit of sustainable development."

cleaned_content/syr/longer-report#2.2_p1,adaptation,"International climate agreements, rising national ambitions for climate action, along with rising public awareness are accelerating efforts to address climate change at multiple levels of governance. Mitigation policies have contributed to a decrease in global energy and carbon intensity, with several countries achieving GHG emission reductions for over a decade. Low-emission technologies are becoming more affordable, with many low or zero emissions options now available for energy, buildings, transport, and industry. Adaptation planning and implementation progress has generated multiple benefits, with effective adaptation options having the potential to reduce climate risks and contribute to sustainable development. Global tracked finance for mitigation and adaptation has seen an upward trend since AR5, but falls short of needs. (high confidence)  "
cleaned_content/syr/longer-report#2.2.1_p1,adaptation;Kyoto Protocol,"The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC), Kyoto Protocol, and Paris Agreement are supporting rising levels of national ambition and encouraging the development and implementation of climate policies at multiple levels of governance (high confidence). The Kyoto Protocol led to reduced emissions in some countries and was instrumental in building national and international capacity for GHG reporting, accounting and emissions markets (high confidence). The Paris Agreement, adopted under the UNFCCC, with near universal participation, has led to policy development and target-setting at national and sub-national levels, particularly in relation to mitigation but also for adaptation, as well as enhanced transparency of climate action and support (medium confidence). Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), required under the Paris Agreement, have required countries to articulate their priorities and ambition with respect to climate action. {WGII 17.4, WGII TS D.1.1; WGIII SPM B.5.1, WGIII SPM E.6}"
cleaned_content/syr/longer-report#2.2.2_p5,adaptation,"The magnitude of global climate finance flows has increased and financing channels have broadened (high confidence). Annual tracked total financial flows for climate mitigation and adaptation increased by up to 60% between 2013/14 and 2019/20, but average growth has slowed since 2018 (medium confidence).and most climate finance stays within national borders (high confidence). Markets for green bonds, environmental, social and governance and sustainable finance products have expanded significantly since AR5 (high confidence). Investors, central banks, and financial regulators are driving increased awareness of climate risk to support climate policy development and implementation (high confidence). Accelerated international financial cooperation is a critical enabler of low-GHG and just transitions (high confidence).{WGIII SPM B.5.4, WGIII SPM E.5, WGIII TS.6.3, WGIII TS.6.4}"
cleaned_content/syr/longer-report#2.2.3_p2,adaptation;Deforestation;ecosystem services,"Adaptation to water-related risks and impacts make up the majority (~60%) of all documented 83  adaptation. (high confidence). A large number of these adaptation responses are in the agriculture sector and these include on-farm water management, water storage, soil moisture conservation, and irrigation. Other adaptations in agriculture include cultivar improvements, agroforestry, community-based adaptation and farm and landscape diversification among others (high confidence). For inland flooding, combinations of non-structural measures like early warning systems, enhancing natural water retention such as by restoring wetlands and rivers, and land use planning such as no build zones or upstream forest management, can reduce flood risk (medium confidence). Some land-related adaptation actions such as sustainable food production, improved and sustainable forest management, soil organic carbon management, ecosystem conservation and land restoration, reduced deforestation and degradation, and reduced food loss and waste are being undertaken, and can have mitigation co-benefits (high confidence). Adaptation actions that increase the resilience of biodiversity and ecosystem services to climate change include responses like minimising additional stresses or disturbances, reducing fragmentation, increasing natural habitat extent, connectivity and heterogeneity, and protecting small-scale refugia where microclimate conditions can allow species to persist (high confidence). Most innovations in urban adaptation have occurred through advances in disaster risk management, social safety nets and green/blue infrastructure (medium confidence). Many adaptation measures that benefit health and well-being are found in other sectors (e.g., food, livelihoods, social protection, water and sanitation, infrastructure) (high confidence). {WGII SPM C.2.1, WGII SPM C.2.2, WGII TS.D.1.2, WGII TS.D.1.4, WGII TS.D.4.2, WGII TS.D.8.3, WGII 4 ES; SRCCL SPM B.1.1}"
cleaned_content/syr/longer-report#2.2.3_p4,adaptation,"Globally tracked adaptation finance has shown an upward trend since AR5, but represents only a small portion of total climate finance, is uneven and has developed heterogeneously across regions and sectors (high confidence). Adaptation finance has come predominantly from public sources, largely through grants, concessional and non-concessional instruments (very high confidence).

If advancing spring phenology results in earlier breeding, this may offset the effect of rising temperatures in the breeding range and reduce the effect of increasing temperature on body size (Zimova et al., 2021). A study of 52 species of North American migratory birds, based on >70,000 specimens, showed that spring migration phenology has advanced over the past 40 years, concurrent with widespread shifts in morphology (reduced body size and increased wing length), perhaps to compensate for the increased metabolic cost of flight as body size decreases (Weeks et al., 2020)."

Many behavioural, morphological and physiological responses are highly species- and context-specific, making generalisations difficult (Bodensteiner et al., 2021). Recent advances in mechanistic understanding (from experiments), in process-based modelling (including micro-climates and developmental processes) (Carter and Janzen, 2021) and in the sophistication of niche models (Kearney et al., 2009) have improved projections, but comprehensive tests of geographic patterns and processes in thermal tolerance and plasticity are still lacking, with studies limited to a few phylogenetically restricted analyses showing mixed results (Gunderson and Stillman, 2015). Improved understanding of the mechanistic basis for observed geographic patterns in thermal tolerance and plasticity is needed to identify the physiological limits of species, the potential for adaptation and the presence of evolutionary trade-offs, which will strongly influence population declines, species range shifts, invasive interactions and the success of conservation interventions (Cooke et al., 2021; Ryan and Gunderson, 2021)."

This adaptation to lengthening summers enables them to delay overwintering until later and add an extra generation each year (Bradshaw and Holzapfel, 2001). Among 26 populations of Drosophila subobscura studied on three continents, 22 experienced climate warming across two or more decades, and 21 of these 22 showed increasing frequency of the chromosome inversion characteristic of populations adapted to hot climates  (robust evidence, high agreement)  (Balanya et al., 2006)."

Tests of thermal performance have been complicated, as both long-term acclimation and trans-generational effects occur (Sgro et al., 2016). However, the results to date have been consistent: despite widespread local adaptation to climate across species’ ranges, substantial constraints exist regarding the evolution of greater stress tolerance (e.g., high temperatures and drought) at warm range limits (medium evidence, high agreement ) (Hoffmann and Sgro, 2011; MacLean et al., 2019b)."

For example, no one would advocate moving polar bears to Antarctica, as they would likely feast on native penguins, thus causing another conservation problem. However, moving species only a few hundred kilometers avoids most adverse outcomes, and this is often all that is needed to help a wild plant or animal cope with lower levels of climate change. In extreme cases, another type of assisted adaptation is to preserve species until we can stabilize then reverse climate change, and then reintroduce them to the wild.

The impacts of fire often depend on interactions with non-climatic factors such as habitat fragmentation (Slingsby et al., 2020b) and management (Steel et al., 2015) or the spread of flammable exotic plantation forestry and invasive species (Kraaij et al., 2018; McWethy et al., 2018). Managing these factors provides opportunities for adaptation and mitigation (Moreira et al., 2020). (See sections 2.4.4.2 and 2.5.3.2)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.2.4 _p6,adaptation,"Human adaptation and mitigation responses to climate change may create additional threats to MTEs. MTEs have dry summers by definition, posing a challenge for the year-round supply of water to growing human populations and agriculture. With recent major droughts in all MTEs (Section 2.4.3.6), there is increasing reliance on groundwater for the bulk of the water supply (Kaiser and Macleod, 2018). The majority of groundwater systems have exceeded or are rapidly approaching their environmental flow limits (de Graaf et al., 2019), threatening human populations and ecosystems that depend on these systems for their persistence through unfavourable climatic conditions (McLaughlin et al., 2017). Similarly, much of the MTEs are open shrublands and grasslands and proposed extensive tree-planting to sequester atmospheric CO2 could result in a loss of biodiversity and threaten water security (Doblas-Miranda et al., 2017; Bond et al., 2019)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#FAQ 2.4_p2,adaptation,"Human health and well-being are highly dependent on the ‘health’ of nature. Biodiversity—the variety of genes, species, communities and ecosystems—provides services that are essential for human health and productive livelihoods, such as breathable air, drinkable water, productive oceans and fertile soils for growing food and fuels. Natural ecosystems also help store carbon and regulate climate, floods, disease, pollution and water quality. The loss of species, leading to reduced biodiversity, has direct and measurable negative effects on all of these essential services, and therefore on humankind. A recent demonstration of this is the decline of pollinator species, with potential negative effects on crop pollination, a fundamental ecosystem function crucial for agriculture. The loss of wild relatives of the domesticated varieties that humans rely on for agriculture reduces the genetic variability that may be needed to support the adaptation of crops to future environmental and social challenges."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6 _p1,adaptation,"Adaptation to reduce the vulnerability of ecosystems and their services to climate change has been addressed in previous IPCC reports, with AR4 and AR5 recognising both autonomous adaptation and human-assisted adaptation to protect natural species and ecosystems. In AR5, Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA), adaptation for people, based on the better protection, restoration and management of the natural environment, was identified as an area of emerging opportunity, with a dedicated Cross-Chapter Box on the topic. In the SRCCL, conservation, EbA and related concepts were integrated throughout; SR1.5 also noted the role of EbA. Since the last assessment report, the scientific literature has expanded considerably, with growing interest in the concept of Nature-based Solutions (NbS). This section assesses this new literature and its implications for the implementation of climate change adaptation."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6 _p4,adaptation,"It is worth briefly considering some key concepts that are relevant to adaptation in ecosystems. Adaptation for biodiversity and ecosystems can encompass both managing change and building resilience. We use the definition of ‘resilience’ set out Chapter 1: ‘the capacity of social, economic and environmental systems to cope with a hazardous event or trend or disturbance, responding or reorganising in ways that maintain their essential function, identity and structure while also maintaining the capacity for adaptation, learning and transformation’. This includes the concept of ‘resistance’, which is used in some ecological literature to distinguish systems which are resistant to change from those that recover quickly from change. We consider both interventions designed primarily to protect biodiversity and those intended to reduce the risks of climate change to people."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6 _p5,adaptation;climate change mitigation;ecosystem services;IUCN,"A variety of terms are used to describe using environmental management to reduce the impacts of climate change on people in ways that also benefit biodiversity in the scientific literature, particularly EbA and NbS (see also Section 1.4). EbA is the use of biodiversity and ecosystem services as part of an overall adaptation strategy to help people to adapt to climate change (Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, 2020). EbA aims to maintain and increase the resilience and reduce the vulnerability of ecosystems and people in the face of the adverse effects of climate change (Vignola et al., 2009). NbS is a broader term which is not restricted to climate change, and is also often used to refer to climate change mitigation; it has been defined by the IUCN as ‘Actions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural or modified ecosystems that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits’ (Cohen-Shacham et al., 2016). This widely accepted definition excludes actions which use the natural environment to solve human problems but do not provide benefits for biodiversity, and is closely linked to the concept of the Ecosystem Approach. NbS is not a universally accepted term, but it is being increasingly used in the scientific literature. It is a concept which recognises the importance of biodiversity in ecosystem service provision, and offers the opportunity to address climate change and loss of biodiversity together in an efficient integrated way (Chong, 2014; Seddon et al., 2020a; Ortiz et al., 2021). Given that the focus of this chapter is on adaptation, we primarily use the term EbA as it is more specific, but we do so understanding that it can be regarded as a subset of NbS. The wider concept of NbS for climate change adaptation and mitigation is covered in a cross-chapter box on the topic (see Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL in this chapter)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6 _p6,adaptation,"Whilst we distinguish between adaptation for biodiversity and EbA, it is important to recognise that the two are linked in that, if ecosystems themselves are not resilient to climate change, they will not be able to provide adaptation benefits for people. The case for resourcing biodiversity conservation and building the resilience of ecosystems is also strengthened when there are direct benefits for people in addition to the more general benefits of biodiversity."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6 _p7,adaptation,"Ecosystems are specifically included in the adaptation goals set out in the Paris Agreement and are addressed in most national adaptation plans (Seddon et al., 2020b). There are also now a large number of adaptation programmes and plans for local governments and governmental and non-governmental conservation organisations. Adaptation for and by ecosystems needs to be understood and developed in the wider contexts of conservation, climate resilient development and sustainable development. There are significant potential synergies but also conflicts between different objectives which require an integrated approach (covered further in 2.6.7)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.1_p1,adaptation,"Natural ecosystems often have a high degree of resilience and can, to some extent, adjust to change. Species can adjust through evolutionary adaptation, distribution change, behavioural change, developmental plasticity and ecophysiological adjustment. There are, however, limits to autonomous adaptation, because of intrinsic limitations, the rate at which the climate is changing and the degraded state of many ecosystems."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.1_p3,adaptation,Some of the reasons cited in the literature as limits to autonomous adaptation are:
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.2_p1,adaptation,"A variety of approaches have been identified as potential adaptation measures which people can take to reduce the risks of climate change to biodiversity. (Heller and Zavaleta, 2009 ), quoted in AR5, identified 113 categories of recommendation for adaptation from a survey of 112 papers and reports. Since then, the literature has expanded with thousands of relevant publications. Whilst there is increasing interest in adaptation for biodiversity conservation and a wide range of plans and strategies, there is less evidence of these plans being implemented. Since AR5, a number of studies, predominantly from Europe and North America, have investigated the extent to which adaptation has been integrated into conservation planning and is being implemented on a local and regional scale (Macgregor and van Dijk, 2014; Delach et al., 2019; Prober et al., 2019; Clifford et al., 2020; Barr et al., 2021; Duffield et al., 2021). A common pattern in these studies is that vulnerability has been assessed and potential adaptation actions identified, but implementation has been limited beyond actions to improve ecological conditions which may increase resilience on a local scale."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.2_p2,adaptation,"To date, most scientific literature on adaptation to reduce the risks to biodiversity from climate change has been based on ecological theory rather than on observations or practical experience. A recent review (Prober et al., 2019) concluded that out of 473 papers on adaptation, only 16% presented new empirical evidence and very few assessed the effectiveness of actual adaptation actions. It is also the case that relatively little research is focused on local-scale management interventions rather than on larger-scale strategies (Ledee et al., 2021), although there are some exceptions (Duffield et al., 2021)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.2_p3,adaptation;weather,"Although direct assessments of the effectiveness of adaptation actions are rare, since AR5, there have been an increasing number of empirical analyses of how different land use and management can influence the vulnerability of species and habitats. As climate change often interacts with other factors including ecosystem degradation and fragmentation (Oliver et al., 2015a), actions to address these other interacting factors is expected to build resilience to climate change. Table 2.6 summarises evidence that supports the main categories of proposed adaptation measures. We have taken an inclusive approach and included studies that address extreme weather events such as droughts, which may be exacerbated by climate change, as well as long-term changes in climate variables. We have not distinguished between studies in which climate change adaptation was an explicit focus and those in which lessons for adaptation can be learnt, that is, when studies were conducted for other reasons but inform the assessment of the impacts of actions identified as potential adaptation measures."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.2_p4,adaptation,"Table 2.6 | Evidence to support proposed climate change adaptation measures for biodiversity. The evidence highlights that adaptation for biodiversity conservation is a broad concept, encompassing a wide range of actions. It includes targeted interventions to change the microclimate for particular species (e.g., by creating shade) to changing national conservation objectives to take account of changing distributions of species and communities. It includes targeted actions addressing both climate change and the protection and restoration of ecosystems, with multiple additional benefits including reduced vulnerability to climate change. Most of the studies are not direct tests of the impacts of adaptation actions which, as noted above, is an important gap in the evidence. There is also a major limitation in that reported studies are predominantly from Europe, North America and Australasia, with little research in other regions."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.2_p6,adaptation,"Many climate adaptation actions for biodiversity operate on the landscape scale (von Holle et al., 2020). The total area of habitat, how fragmented it is, the size of habitat patches and the connectivity between them are inter-linked properties on this scale. A growing number of studies have investigated how these properties affect species ability to persist in situ and colonise new areas. Overall, larger areas of semi-natural habitat are associated with increased resilience to ongoing climate change and extreme events as well as the capacity to colonise new areas (Haslem et al., 2015; Oliver et al., 2017; Papanikolaou et al., 2017). Larger habitat patches can support larger populations of a given species, which are more likely to maintain themselves and recover from periods of adverse conditions. Inhabiting a large patch size has been found to increase the resilience of some populations of species to extreme events such as droughts (Oliver et al., 2015b). They are also more likely to provide a range of different resources and microclimate conditions, which may increase the chances of the persistence of species under climate change. A larger area of habitat may also enable greater connectivity between patches and increase the chances of species colonising new areas as they track climate change (Oliver et al., 2015b)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.2_p7,adaptation,"Protecting and restoring natural processes is a general principle for maintaining and building resilience to climate change for biodiversity (Timpane-Padgham et al., 2017). One element of this is ensuring naturally functioning hydrology for wetlands and river systems (Table 2.6), which is particularly important in a context of changing rainfall patterns and increased evapotranspiration. An important development in approaches to conservation over recent decades has been the concept of re-wilding (Schulte To Bühne et al., 2021); this encompasses a number of elements of restoring natural processes, including the reintroduction of top predators, larger conservation areas, and less prescriptive outcomes than many previous conservation measures. There are elements of re-wilding which may well contribute to building resilience to climate change, but it will be increasingly important to factor climate change adaptation into the planning of re-wilding schemes (Carroll and Noss, 2021)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.2_p8,adaptation,"The most consistently cited climate change adaptation measure for species is increasing connectivity to facilitate the colonisation of new areas. This reflects the fact that many species’ habitats are highly fragmented in areas with more intensive land management, which prevents them naturally changing their range to track changing climatic conditions. Advances and innovations in modelling techniques can support decision-making about connectivity (Littlefield et al., 2019). There is evidence from empirical and modelling studies that species can disperse more effectively in better-connected areas in terrestrial habitats (Keeley et al., 2018). The issues are different in more natural landscapes—species may still be threatened in intrinsically isolated habitats, such as mountain tops, but connectivity cannot be created here in the same way. Evidence suggests that increased connectivity will only benefit a subset of species, probably those which are intermediate-habitat specialists that are able to disperse (Pearce-Higgins and Green, 2014). Generalists do not require corridors or stepping stones, while many corridors or stepping stones will not be of sufficient quality to be used by most habitat specialists. There should also be a caveat to the general principle that increasing connectivity is a benefit for climate change adaptation. It can increase the spread of invasive, pest and disease-causing species into newly suitable regions. In some places, isolated refugia may better allow vulnerable species and biological communities to survive."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.2_p10,adaptation,"Managed translocation, that is, moving species from areas where the climate is becoming unsuitable to places where their persistence under climate change is more likely , has been discussed as an adaptation option for many years. So far, there have been very few examples of this and it is likely to be a last resort in most cases, as it usually requires a large investment of resources, outcomes are uncertain and there may be adverse impacts on the receiving sites. Nevertheless, there are cases where it may be a be a viable option (Stralberg et al., 2019). This is discussed in more detail as a case study in Section 2.6.5.1."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.2_p11,adaptation,"The evidence that species can persist in microclimatic refugia  where suitable conditions for them are maintained locally (e.g., because of variations in topography) has increased in recent years. This has opened up the potential to include refugia in conservation plans and strategies to facilitate the local survival of species (Jones et al., 2016; Morelli et al., 2016; Morelli et al., 2020), for example, targeting management actions (Sweet et al., 2019) aimed at supporting populations of species. This is likely to become an important aspect of climate change adaptation for biodiversity conservation in future. It is also possible to manipulate microclimate, for example, by creating shelters for birds’ nests; see Case Study in 2.6.5.5 of African penguins; (Patino-Martinez et al., 2012). One specific approach of this sort is the planting or retention of trees and wooded corridors to shade watercourses (Thomas et al., 2016). Riparian shading can also possibly help to reduce phytoplankton and benthic diatom growth in smaller streams and rivers (Halliday et al., 2016)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.2_p15,adaptation,"It is intrinsically difficult to assess the effectiveness of climate change adaptation measures, the benefit of which will be realised in the years and decades ahead (Morecroft et al., 2019). Nevertheless, taking into account the wide range of evidence reported above, including the theory, modelling and observations of the impacts of climate change in contrasting circumstances, it is possible to make an overarching assessment that appropriate adaptation measures can reduce the vulnerability of many aspects of biodiversity to climate change (robust evidence, high agreement ). It is also clear, however, that to be most effective and avoid unintended consequences, measures need to be carefully implemented by taking into account specific local circumstances  (robust evidence, high agreement)  and include the management of inevitable changes (robust evidence, high agreement ). It is also clear that while there are now many plans and strategies for adapting biodiversity conservation to climate change, many have yet to be implemented fully (medium evidence, high agreement )."

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.3_p8,adaptation,"EbA can operate on a range of different scales, from local to catchment to region. On the local scale, there is a variety of circumstances in which microclimates can be managed and local temperatures lowered by the presence of vegetation (Table 2.7), and these EbA techniques are now being used more widely. In both urban and agricultural situations, shade trees are a traditional technique which can be applied to contemporary climate change adaptation. As reported in Section 2.6.2 above, shading of watercourses can lower temperatures, which can allow species to survive locally; as well as supporting diversity, it can help to maintain important fisheries, including those of salmonid fish (O’Briain et al., 2020). Within cities, green spaces, including parks, local nature reserves and green roofs and walls can also provide cooling as a result of evapotranspiration (Bowler et al., 2010a; Aram et al., 2019; Hobbie and Grimm, 2020), although this may be reduced in drought conditions."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.3_p10,adaptation,"EbA is usually a place-specific approach and a number of studies have documented how attempts to implement it without an understanding of local circumstances and the full engagement of local communities have been unsuccessful (Nalau et al., 2018). Since AR5, a number of studies have considered the factors that are important for environment adaptation programmes and projects (UNFCCC, 2015; Nalau et al., 2018; Duncan et al., 2020; EPA Network and ENCA, 2020; Townsend et al., 2020). Considering these sources, others described above and the case studies presented in Section 2.6.5, a number of requirements for effective implementation of EbA can be identified, including the following:"
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.3_p12,adaptation,"Whilst it is essential to develop place-specific EbA measures with the full engagement of local communities, it is worth noting that new opportunities may emerge that would not have been possible in the past. As the climate changes, novel ecosystems may emerge (with no present day analogue) which have the potential to provide different adaptation benefits, and societies may be more willing to adopt transformative approaches (Colloff et al., 2017; Lavorel et al., 2020)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.3_p13,adaptation;IUCN,"Increasingly, it is essential to integrate adaptation and the protection of biodiversity with land-based initiatives to mitigate climate change; this is discussed in more detail in Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL in this chapter. The new IUCN standard (IUCN, 2020) offers a basis for assessing whether actions are true NbS and take into account the wider factors necessary for success."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.5_p1,adaptation,"Adaptation plans for biodiversity and EbA have been adopted in many places and on different scales, but it is difficult to get a systematic overview of adaptation in practice. We have therefore reviewed a series of contrasting case studies to illustrate some of the key issues. There is a pressing need for more thorough monitoring and evaluation of adaptation to assess effectiveness. Climate change adaptation is conceptually difficult to measure, but it is possible to test which techniques work in reducing vulnerability and to monitor their deployment (Morecroft et al., 2019)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.5_p2,adaptation,"Adaptation can take place on a range of scales, with specific projects nested within overarching national strategies. Small-scale projects can be adaptation-focused, but on the larger scale, adaptation is often integrated with wider objectives. Within an urban or peri-urban context, the benefits of natural and semi-natural areas for health and well-being help to justify support for EbA. Economic well-being is also an important factor in many cases whether, as in Durban, South Africa (Section 2.6.5.7), it provides new job opportunities or, as in the Andes (Section 2.6.5.4), it supports long-established agricultural practices. Action on the ground often depends on factors on a range of scales, for example, a local plan, a national strategy and international funding. In Durban, partnerships between local communities, local authorities and the academic community were essential, together with an international context. Nevertheless, there are examples of communities using traditional or local knowledge (LK) to adapt to changing circumstances, with little or no external input, (Section 2.6.5.4); Their scope for adaptation is, however, often limited by factors beyond their direct control."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.5_p3,adaptation;weather,"Specific interventions to protect species from climate change, such as the case of African penguins in South Africa (Section 2.6.5.5) and threatened plant species in the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area (Section 2.6.5.8), are rare. However, in countries where nature reserves are actively managed or where ecosystem restoration projects are progressing, local practitioners may use their knowledge to adapt to weather conditions and their associated effects (e.g., fire and water shortages). This is good practice, but it may not be sufficient to address the likely future changes in climate (Duffield et al., 2021). Training and resources to support conservation practitioners are becoming available. Examples include the Climate Change Adaptation Manual in England, UK (Section 2.6.5.2), and The Alliance for Freshwater Life (https://allianceforfreshwaterlife.org) which provides expertise for the sustainable management of freshwater biodiversity (Darwall et al., 2018)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.5_p4,adaptation;ecosystem services,"Adaptation is widely recognised as important for national conservation policies and is being considered in a variety of countries (Section 2.6.5.2, 2.6.5.3). Adaptation in this strategic context includes decisions about the selection and objectives for protected areas, for example, identifying places which can act as refugia. It can also mean recognising where protected areas remain important but will support a changing range of species and ecosystems. This is important for directing resources effectively and ensuring that the management of the sites remains appropriate. There are, however, often major uncertainties, and the extent to which there will be a need for more radical measures will depend on the success of reducing GHG emissions globally. A global rise of 1.5°C–2°C would require relatively incremental adjustments to conservation management in many parts of the world, but a 3°C–4°C rise would require radical, transformational changes to preserve many species and maintain ecosystem services (Morecroft et al., 2012)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.5_p5,adaptation,"Whilst adaptation strategies for conservation are relatively common, at least on an outline level, their implementation is slow in most places. This may partly reflect a lack of resources for conservation in many parts of the world; however, another barrier is that people often value protected sites in their present form. Actions which might jeopardise this are inevitably a last resort. Initiatives to engage wider communities in discussions are likely to be essential in gaining support for such changing approaches."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.5_p6,adaptation,"EbA and adaptation for biodiversity are intrinsically linked and the largest-scale interventions for adaptation in ecosystems have tended to bring together both elements. For example, adaptation to reduce the risk of flooding by habitat creation and using natural processes (Section 2.6.5.2, Cross-Chapter Box SLR in Chapter 3), such as re-naturalising straightened river systems or creating wetlands for water storage, offers the potential to meet multiple objectives and has increased the overall funding available for ecosystem restoration."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.5.1_p6,adaptation,"The success of assisted migration for conservation purposes has been variable. Bellis et al. (2019) identified 56 successes and 33 failures among 107 translocations of insects undertaken explicitly for conservation purposes. They concluded that failure was most strongly associated with the low numbers of individuals being released. Another potential source of failure is local adaptation: there is good evidence that adaptive differences among potential source populations can be important. For example, the transplants of Chamaecrista fasciculata were more successful when sourced from the most poleward existing sites, while individuals from more equatorial habitats performed poorly even when artificially warmed (Wadgymar et al., 2015)."

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.5.2_p3,adaptation;weather,"Threats to biodiversity from climate change in England include range retractions of cold-adapted species and the effects of more frequent extreme weather events such as drought. These threats are exacerbated by land use and management, for example, fragmenting habitats, draining land and straightening rivers. There are also risks to people, which are exacerbated by environmental factors, including flooding and over-heating in urban areas. The National Adaptation Programme provides a broad policy framework for England and includes a chapter on the natural environment. There are also adaptation plans produced by public bodies such as Natural England and the UK Environment Agency, with a wide range of responsibilities including flood defence. The principles of adaptation to climate change are well established in the UK conservation community and resources are available. Natural England has published a Climate Change Adaptation Manual jointly with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (a major conservation NGO) (Natural England and RSPB, 2020) and a spatial mapping tool for vulnerability to climate change (Taylor et al., 2014)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.5.2_p4,adaptation,"Duffield et al. (2021) found that awareness of the need for adaptation was common amongst nature reserve managers and that they were implementing actions that might build resilience to climate change, such as restoring ecosystem processes and reducing habitat fragmentation. There was recognition that it will be necessary to change the management objectives of protected sites to adjust to changing circumstances, but little implementation of such changes. The main example of managing change was at the coast where the SLR is causing transitions from terrestrial and freshwater systems to coastal and marine ones."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.5.2_p5,adaptation,"A range of EbA approaches are starting to contribute to adaptation in England, but the best-developed is Natural Flood Management (NFM): restoring natural processes and natural habitats to reduce flood risk (Wingfield et al., 2019). Over the last decade, a series of NFM projects have been established in local areas. The Environment Agency collated the evidence base for NFM (Burgess-Gamble et al., 2021) and was able to draw on 65 case studies (Ngai et al., 2017) covering the management of rivers and floodplains, woodlands, runoff, and coasts and estuaries."

In Peru, montane ice-field meltwater provides 80% of the water resources for the arid coast where half the population lives (Thompson et al., 2021). Increasing variability of precipitation has compromised rain-fed agriculture and power generation, particularly in the dry season, exacerbating pressures for new sources of water (Bradley et al., 2006; Bury et al., 2013; Buytaert et al., 2017). There is therefore a risk of increasing conflicts between adaptation to climate change to benefit human and natural communities in the high Andes and maintaining water provisioning for lowland agricultural and urban areas."

Increasing access to food resources is a management priority (Birdlife International, 2018). One approach is to reduce fishing pressure immediately around breeding colonies. An experiment excluding fishing around colonies since 2008 has demonstrated positive effects (Pichegru et al., 2010; Pichegru et al., 2012; Sherley et al., 2015; Sherley et al., 2018; Campbell et al., 2019b). A second approach is to establish breeding colonies closer to their prey. An ongoing translocation initiative aims to entice birds eastwards, to recolonise an extinct breeding colony and potentially establish a new one (Schwitzer et al., 2013; Sherley et al., 2014; Birdlife International, 2018). Penguin ‘look-alikes’ or decoys, constructed from rubber and concrete, have been placed at the site of the extinct colony, and, along with call play-backs, these give the illusion of an established penguin colony (Morris and Hagen, 2018). This approach has not yet proven successful."

Artificial nest boxes of various designs and constructed from a range of materials have been explored, in combination with the use of natural vegetation. Some designs have proven successful, increasing breeding success (Kemper et al., 2007; Sherley et al., 2012), but the same designs have had less success at other locations (Pichegru, 2013; Lei et al., 2014)."

The national park used spatial analyses of suitable climate to identify potential refugia under all emissions scenarios, except for the highest (Barrows and Murphy-Mariscal, 2012; Sweet et al., 2019). The park prioritises the refugia for removal of invasive grasses and fire control (Barrows et al., 2020) and works to restore refugia that have burned in fires, using native plants, including nursery-grown Joshua tree seedlings.

High levels of development, particularly in peri-urban areas, have encroached into natural habitats (World Bank, 2016). Degradation of the natural resource base in this way has direct economic and financial costs, is threatening Durban’s long-term sustainability and is exacerbated by climate change (World Bank, 2016; eThekwini Municipality, 2020). The impacts of climate change are anticipated to increase unless appropriate mitigation and adaptation interventions are prioritised (eThekwini Municipality, 2020). High rates of poverty, unemployment and health problems have pushed Durban to explore a climate change adaptation work stream within its MCPP (Roberts et al., 2013; Roberts et al., 2020b)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.5.7_p4,adaptation;urban heat island,"A single approach to adaptation is likely to be insufficient (Archer et al., 2014), and community-based adaptation should be integrated as part of a package of tools applied at the city level. Durban’s climate change adaptation work stream is composed of three separate components: municipal adaptation (adaptation activities linked to the key functions of local government), community-based adaptation (CbA, focused on improving the adaptive capacity of local communities), and a series of urban management interventions (addressing specific challenges such as the urban heat island, increased storm-water runoff, water conservation and SLR) (Roberts et al., 2013)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.5.7_p5,adaptation,"Lessons learnt from Durban’s experience include the importance of meaningful partnerships, long-term financial commitments (Douwes et al., 2015) and significant political and administrative will (Roberts et al., 2012; Roberts et al., 2020b). Securing these requires strong leadership (Douwes et al., 2015), including from local champions (Archer et al., 2014), even when EbA is considered cost-effective (Roberts et al., 2012). Projects for the restoration of natural habitats are seen as an ideal tool, as they combine mitigation outcomes with an increased adaptation capacity, not only reducing the vulnerability of ecosystems and communities (Douwes et al., 2016) but creating economic opportunities. These include direct job creation (Diederichs and Roberts, 2016; Douwes and Buthelezi, 2016) with various spin-offs such as better education for schoolchildren (Douwes et al., 2015). Indirect benefits, including better water quality and reduced flooding, are generated as a result of improved ecosystem service delivery (Douwes and Buthelezi, 2016). In areas that are already developed, opportunities for green-roof infrastructure can yield reductions in roof storm-water runoff (by approx.. 60 ml/m 2/min during a rainfall event), slow the release of water over time and reduce temperatures on roof surfaces (Roberts et al., 2012)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.5.9_p7,adaptation,"Implementation of these measures with the help of local communities improved the lake’s health. NbS are more resilient adaptation measures towards climate change. Restoration not only reduced water stress but also provides multiple societal benefits in the urban area (Kabisch et al., 2016)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.5.10_p4,adaptation,"Improving the resilience of SEA peatlands to fire and climate change through restoration is extremely difficult and presents many challenges. The Indonesian government has tasked the Badan Restorasi Gambut (Peatland Restoration Agency) to restore peatlands (Darusman et al., 2021; Giesen, 2021). Other local initiatives exist, such as fire management programmes and restoration projects (Puspitaloka et al., 2020). Since 2016, the government of Indonesia has re-wetted ~380,000 hectares of degraded peatlands, mainly by blocking canals and flooding, but less than 2000 hectares have been successfully restored to sustaining native plant species common to peat swamp forests (Giesen, 2021). Replanting native trees has had relatively little success (Lampela et al., 2017) because such trees have low tolerance to prolonged inundation and no fire adaptation strategies (Page et al., 2009; Roucoux et al., 2013; Dohong et al., 2018; Cole et al., 2019; Luom, 2020; Giesen, 2021)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.6_p1,adaptation,"The evidence summarised above (Sections 2.6.2–2.6.4) shows that by restoring ecosystems it is possible to increase their resilience to climate change, including the resilience of the populations of species they support and of human communities. However, changes to healthy ecosystems and biodiversity are already happening as described in this chapter (robust evidence, high agreement ) and further changes are inevitable even in scenarios of low GHG emissions (robust evidence, high agreement ). Planning to manage the consequences of inevitable changes and prioritise investments in conservation actions where they have the best chance of succeeding (e.g., Section 2.6.5.6) will be an increasingly necessary component of adaptation (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Table 2.6)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.6_p6,adaptation;climate change mitigation,"In general, adaptation measures can substantially reduce the adverse impacts of 1°C–2°C of global temperature rise, but beyond this losses will increase (IPCC, 2018b), including species extinctions and changes like major biome shifts which cannot be reversed on human time scales. Some adaptation measures will also become less effective at higher temperatures. Whilst adaptation is essential to reduce risks, it cannot be regarded as a substitute for effective climate change mitigation (robust evidence, high agreement )."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.7_p3,adaptation;ecosystem services,"There is also increasing evidence, reported in this chapter, that the loss and degradation of natural and semi-natural habitats exacerbates the impacts of climate change and climatic extreme events on biodiversity and ecosystem services (high confidence) (e.g., in (Ogden et al., 2013; Eigenbrod et al., 2015; Struebig et al., 2015; Stevens et al., 2016; Oliver et al., 2017; McAlpine et al., 2018; Taffarello et al., 2018; Lehikoinen et al., 2019; Birk et al., 2020; Chapman et al., 2020; Agol et al., 2021; Khaniya et al., 2021; Lara et al., 2021; Lehikoinen et al., 2021). Considering these two sets of evidence together, it is clear that climate change adaptation and ecosystem degradation both need to be addressed if either is to be tackled successfully (robust evidence, high agreement ) as a number of recent publications concluded (Haddad et al., 2015; Hannah et al., 2020; Arneth et al., 2021; Pörtner et al., 2021). Taking this combined body of evidence, the assessment is that the protection and restoration of natural and semi-natural ecosystems are key adaptation measures (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Section 2.5.4)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.7_p6,adaptation;climate change mitigation,"At a local level, EbA can often provide a wide range of additional benefits for sustainable development in both rural and urban areas (Wilbanks, 2003; Nelson et al., 2007; Cohen-Shacham et al., 2016; Hobbie and Grimm, 2020; Martín et al., 2020). A number of the case studies above, such as in Durban and at Bhojtal Lake, illustrate this (section 2.6.5). A key element of CRD is ensuring that actions taken to mitigate climate change do not compromise adaptation, biodiversity and human needs. This depends on choosing appropriate actions for different locations (Box 2.2, Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL in this chapter). A particularly notable case of this is the creation of woodland described in Box 2.2: re-afforestation of previously forested areas can provide multiple benefits (Lee et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2020) including those for climate change mitigation, adaptation and biodiversity. However, planting trees where they would not naturally grow can create multiple problems including the loss of native biodiversity and the disruption of hydrology (Box 2.2). It is also the case that protection of existing natural forest ecosystems is the highest priority for reducing GHG emissions (Moomaw et al., 2019) and restoration may not always be practical (see Section 2.6.5.10). (Sections 2.4.3.6, 2.4.3.7, 2.4.4.3, 2.4.4.4, 2.5.2.6, 2.5.2.7, 2.5.3.3, Box 2.2, Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL in this chapter)"
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.7_p7,adaptation;climate change mitigation,"In some cases, actions supported by international donors and presented as addressing climate change adaptation and mitigation in the natural environment can have damaging consequences for people and nature as well as failing to deliver adaptation and mitigation. One example of this was presented by Work et al. (2019), who reviewed three climate change mitigation and adaptation projects in Cambodia: an irrigation project, a protected-area forest management project and a reforestation project. In each case, they found evidence of the rights of local communities being violated, maladaptation and the destruction of biodiverse habitats. They concluded that the potential for maladaptation and adverse social and environmental impacts had been ignored by international donors and the national authorities, and that there was a need for much stricter accountability mechanisms. Moyo et al. (2021), using case studies from South Africa, documented greater success of ecosystem restoration projects when they embraced broader SDGs, particularly enhancement of people’s livelihoods. Better assessment of the impacts of adaptation and mitigation measures on people and ecosystems, before they are implemented, will be increasingly necessary to avoid unintended and damaging consequences as their deployment is scaled up (Larsen, 2014; Enríquez-de-Salamanca et al., 2017; Pour et al., 2017). This applies to ostensibly nature-based approaches as well as more engineering-based ones."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#FAQ 2.5_p2,adaptation,"Protecting and restoring natural environments, such as forests and wetlands, can reduce the risks that climate change poses to people as well as supporting biodiversity, storing carbon and providing many other benefits for human health and well-being. Climate change is bringing an increasing number of threats to people, including flooding, droughts, wildfire, heat waves and rising sea levels. These threats can, however, be reduced or aggravated, depending on how land, sea and freshwater are managed or protected. There is now clear evidence that ‘Nature-based Solutions’ (NbS) can reduce the risks that climate change presents to people. ‘Ecosystem-based Adaptation’ (EbA) is a part of NbS and includes:"
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#FAQ 2.5_p6,adaptation,"If NbS are to be effective, it is important that the right adaptation actions are carried out in the right place and that local communities play an active part in making decisions about their local environment. When they are not part of the process, conflicts can emerge and benefits can be lost."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.8 _p1,adaptation,"The IPCC (2018a) defined feasibility as ‘the degree to which climate goals and response options are considered possible and/or desirable’ (IPCC, 2018b) and set out an approach to assessing the feasibility of pathways to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5°C. Singh et al. (2020) developed this approach for adaptation, recognising six different dimensions of feasibility: economic, technological, institutional, socio-cultural, environmental/ecological and geophysical (Table 2.9). Feasibility is considered more fully in other chapters of this report, including Cross-Chapter Box FEASIB in Chapter 18. Adaptation for biodiversity conservation and EbA encompasses a large range of approaches and techniques (Sections 2.6.2, 2.6.3) and will vary in different contexts globally, as illustrated by the range of case studies (Section 2.6.5). It is important to take into account specific regional and local circumstances as well as the type of adaptation action envisaged before making a feasibility assessment. It is also important to note that what is a feasible adaptation response at one point in time may change with the level of warming experienced—some techniques will be become less effective at higher levels of warming. With global temperature rises of <2°C, in many cases, it will be realistic to build resilience and maintain species and ecosystems in situ, but, at higher levels of warming, this will become increasingly difficult; managing inevitable change, including the consequences of loss and damage, will be important (Prober et al., 2019). Similarly, to be effective at higher levels of warming may require the adaptation of the EbA approaches themselves (Calliari et al., 2019; Martín et al., 2021; Ossola and Lin, 2021). We have therefore not attempted a global-scale assessment of the feasibility of adaptation options, but rather present some key cross-cutting considerations in assessing feasibility for adaptation of and through ecosystems."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.8 _p2,adaptation,"Many of the necessary techniques for climate change adaptation for biodiversity and EbA have been demonstrated and shown to provide a wide range of additional benefits. This does, however, depend on deploying the right techniques in the right place (Box 2.2) as well as engaging local communities (see Section 2.6.6). There is also a challenge where there is high demand for land for other purposes, especially for agriculture and urban development. Table 2.8 summarises the main feasibility considerations, drawing on previous sections. An assessment of constraints on EbA by Nalau et al. (2018) addressed similar issues."

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.8 _p5,adaptation,"A key element of economic feasibility is the cost of adaptation options. Costs of adaptation vary greatly depending on the actions taken, the location, the methods used, the need for ongoing maintenance and whether land purchase is necessary. At its simplest, adaptation may be a matter of taking account of actual or potential climate change impacts in the course of conservation planning and have little or no additional cost. For example, if a species of conservation concern colonises or starts to use a new area as a result of climate change, like migrant waterfowl shifting the locations where they overwinter (Pavón-Jordán et al., 2020), protection or habitat management may be redirected there. At the other extreme, large-scale restoration can incur significant costs, for example, between 1993 and 2015, the EU-LIFE nature programme invested 167.6 million Euro in 80 projects, which aim to restore over 913 km 2 of peatland habitats in Western European countries (Andersen et al., 2017). This is equivalent to <2% of the remaining peatland area, much of which has been affected to at least some extent by human pressures, and restoring the total affected area will cost considerably more."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.8 _p7,adaptation,"The ‘technological’ dimension of feasibility in the context of ecosystems can be regarded as the range of techniques available and the capacity to implement them. As described in Sections 2.6.2 and 2.6.3 above, a wide range of techniques have been developed and are starting to be implemented. There is good evidence to support adaptation for biodiversity and EbA in general terms and, in many cases, adaptation draws on techniques for habitat creation and restoration which have been developed to meet other objectives. However, feasibility needs to be assessed alongside the likely effectiveness: a feasible but ineffective scheme is of no value and the evaluation of success for specific interventions remains poorly developed (Morecroft et al., 2019). It is therefore often important to proceed with the use of pilot studies, good monitoring and the evaluation of outcomes to build confidence before greater deployment of approaches. A linked technical area is the availability of specialist skills and knowledge to implement adaptation; this can vary considerably according to the type of adaptation measure."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.8 _p9,adaptation,"Socio-cultural factors are important for adaptation of the natural environment. Reviewing the constraints of EbA, Nalau et al. (2018) found that risk perceptions and cultural preferences for particular types of management approaches were frequently identified in studies."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.8 _p10,adaptation,"In the IPCC feasibility assessment framework, one integral dimension is ‘environmental/ecological’. In this respect, adaptation by and for ecosystems should perform well, and this may be a reason to prefer EbA to other approaches when there is an alternative. It should, however, be noted that sometimes apparently environmentally positive approaches such as forest creation can be done in ways which are damaging (Section 2.6.7 and Box 2.2) and the impacts need to be critically assessed for local circumstances."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.8 _p11,adaptation,"Geophysical dimensions are important for ecosystems as they have typically shaped which ecosystems can occur where, and feasibility will depend on implementing adaptation options in places where they are appropriate.

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#box-2.2_p1,adaptation;climate change mitigation,"To hold global temperature rise to well below 2°C and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5°C as required by the Paris Agreement requires major changes in land use and management. There are many opportunities for NbS, which can provide climate change mitigation and adaptation in ways that protect and restore biodiversity and provide a wide range of benefits to people (Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL in this chapter). There are also new technologies and approaches to develop the bioeconomy in ways which will provide many benefits (Cross-Working Group Box BIOECONOMY in Chapter 5). Nevertheless, renewable energy is a large and essential element of climate change mitigation and there are adverse impacts on biodiversity associated with some types of renewable energy, including wind and solar technologies (Rehbein et al., 2020). However, one of the most serious conflicts emerging is that between land-based approaches to mitigation and the protection of biodiversity, particularly as a result of afforestation strategies and potentially large areas devoted to bioenergy, including bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). It is important to recognise the impacts of climate change mitigation at the same time as assessing the direct impacts of climate change, and ensure that adaptation and mitigation are joined up."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#FAQ 2.6_p4,adaptation,"Reforestation options include the natural regeneration of the forest, assisted restoration, enrichment planting, native-tree plantations, commercial plantations and directed tree planting in agro-forestry systems and urban areas. Reforestation with native species usually contributes to a wide range of sustainability goals, including biodiversity recovery, improved water filtration and groundwater recharge. It can reduce the risks of soil erosion and floods. In cities, planting trees can support climate change adaptation by reducing the heat of the area, and promote a wide range of social benefits such as providing shade and benefitting outdoor recreation. Urban trees can also lower energy costs by reducing the demand for conventional sources of cooling like air-conditioning, especially during peak-demand periods. It is therefore important to recognise that there are a wide range of different planting and forest management strategies. The choice will depend on the objectives and the location."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#FAQ 2.6_p6,adaptation,"Many of these open areas also occur in low-rainfall areas. Planting trees there uses a lot of water and can cause reductions in stream flow and groundwater. Many of these locations also burn regularly, and planting trees threatens the establishing trees but can also increase the intensity of the fires from that of a grass-fuelled fire to that of a wood-fuelled fire. Swapping grassy ecosystems for forests may contribute to warming, as forests absorb more incoming radiation (warmth) than grasslands. Aside from the negative impacts to adaptation, it is also questionable just how much carbon can be sequestered in these landscapes as planting trees in grassy ecosystems can reduce carbon gains. Furthermore, a high below-ground carbon store prevents carbon loss to fire in these fire-prone environments."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.7.3 _p1,adaptation,"There are significant evidence gaps in developing adaptation, both for biodiversity conservation and EbA. In particular, while many adaptation measures have been proposed and implementation is starting, there are very few evaluations of success in the scientific literature (Morecroft et al., 2019; Prober et al., 2019). As detailed in Section 2.6.2, there is a strong body of literature on conceptual approaches to climate change adaptation for biodiversity but very little empirical testing of which approaches actually work best. Going forward, it is important to put in place good monitoring and evaluation of adaptation strategies. For EbA, there are good examples of measuring changes in response to new adaptation measures, but these remain relatively rare globally."

There is a need for better assessment of global adaptation costs, funding and investment (Micale et al., 2018). Potential synergies between international finance for disaster risk management (DRM) and adaptation have not yet been fully realised. Research has almost exclusively focused on normalising losses for changes in exposure, but not for vulnerability, which is a major gap, given the dynamic nature of vulnerability (Mechler and Bouwer, 2015)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.1.2_p1,adaptation,"The chapter is divided into two main sections. The first section follows an integrative approach in which hazards, exposure, vulnerability, impacts and risks are discussed following the eight climatically homogeneous sub-regions described in WGI AR6 (Figure 12.1). The second section assesses the implemented and proposed adaptation practices by sector; in doing so, it connects to the WGII AR6 cross-chapter themes. The storyline is then a description of the hazards, exposure, vulnerability and impacts providing as much detail as is available in the literature at the sub-regional level, followed by the identification of risks as a result of the interaction of those aspects. This integrated sub-regional approach ensures a balance in the text, particularly for countries that are usually underrepresented in the literature but that show a high level of vulnerability and impacts, such as those observed in CA. The sectoral assessment of adaptation that follows is useful for policymakers and implementers, usually focused and organised by sectors, government ministries or secretaries that can easily locate the relevant adaptation information for their particular sector. To ensure coherence in the chapter, a summary of the assessed adaptation options by key risks is presented, followed by a feasibility assessment for some relevant adaptation options. The chapter closes with case studies and a discussion of the knowledge gaps evidenced in the process of the assessment."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.2_p3,adaptation,"Climate projections indicate increases in temperature for the entire region by 2100 for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, but rainfall changes will vary geographically, with a notable reduction of −22% in northeastern Brazil and an increase of +25% in SES. Significant dependency on rainfed agriculture (>30% in Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua) indicates high sensitivity to climatic variability and change and represents a challenge for food security (high confidence) (SRCCL Chapter 5, Mbow et al., 2019). Undernutrition has worsened since 2014 in CSA (SRCCL Chapter 5, Mbow et al., 2019). Evidence of climate-change impacts on food security is emerging from IKLK studies in SA. Municipalities in CA with a high proportion of subsistence crops tend to have fewer resources for adaptation and more vulnerable to climate change (SRCCL Chapter 5, Mbow et al., 2019). Rising temperature and decreased rainfall could reduce agricultural productivity by 2030, threatening the food security of the poorest populations (WGII AR5 Chapter 27, Magrin et al., 2014). Though reduced suitability and yield for beans, coffee, maize, plantain and rice are expected in CA (SRCCL Chapter 5, Mbow et al., 2019), limiting the warming to 1.5°C, compared with 2°C, are projected to result in smaller net reductions in yields of maize, rice, wheat and other cereal crops for CSA (high confidence) (SR15 Chapter 3, Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018). The heat stress is expected to reduce the suitability of Arabica coffee in Mesoamerica, but it can improve in high-latitude areas in SA (SRCCL Chapter 4, Olsson et al., 2019). There is limited evidence that these declines in crop yields may result in significant population displacement from the tropics to the sub-tropics (SR15 Chapter 3, Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018)."

Protected areas—Indigenous lands included—have significantly reduced forest clear-cutting in the Amazon deforestation arc (most of which is inside SAM) (high confidence) (Nolte et al., 2013). However nearly 100 protected areas in the Amazon, Cerrado and Pantanal biomes inside SAM have been identified as highly or moderately vulnerable to future climate change and demand serious adaptation interventions (medium confidence: medium evidence, high agreement ) (Feeley and Silman, 2016; Lapola et al., 2019b). Yet the maintenance of these protected areas or even the halting of deforestation may do little to impede a large-scale persistent ecosystem shift to an alternative state (crossing a tipping point) of the Amazon rainforest or even more subtle changes caused by climate change in the region (medium confidence: medium evidence, high agreement ) (Aguiar et al., 2016a; Boers et al., 2017; Lapola et al., 2018; Lovejoy and Nobre, 2018)."

Changes in precipitation patterns are related to reductions in agricultural productivity and revenues in the southern portion of the Amazon region (medium confidence: medium evidence, high agreement ) (Costa et al., 2019; Leite-Filho et al., 2021).

This concept is further developed in AR6, defining key risks as potentially severe risks (Section 16.5). Key risks may refer to present or future conditions, with a focus on the 21st century. Both mitigation and adaptation can moderate the extent or severity of risks. The identification and evaluation of risks imply sociocultural values, which may vary across individuals, communities or cultures."

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.4_p11,adaptation,"Overall, most key risks and their severity and extent are strongly driven and determined by system exposure, vulnerability and adaptive capacity. In particular, the high vulnerability of large populations, infrastructure and service systems, such as health, food and energy production and supply, are important factors, along with high levels of inequality and poor governance, for creating and increasing key risks (high confidence). Prevailing low levels of available information and understanding exacerbate the uncertainties surrounding key risks and so pose limitations to adaptation.

Warming has generated extreme heat events in many parts of CSA (IPCC, 2019a) that, together with droughts and floods, will seriously affect the integrity of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems in the entire region (Section 12.3; CAF, 2014). A reduction in net primary productivity in tropical forests and glacier retreat in the Andes, for example, are expected to cause significant negative socioecological impacts (Feldpausch et al., 2016; Lyra et al., 2017; Cuesta et al., 2019) (Case Study, 12.7.1). Biodiversity hotspots in the region are well assessed in the literature compared to other regions of the world, especially the Atlantic Forest, Mesoamerica and Cerrado (Section CCP1.2.2; Manes et al., 2021). Up to 85% of evaluated natural systems (species, habitats and communities) in the literature for biodiversity hotspots since AR5 were projected to be negatively impacted by climate change (high confidence), with 26% of projections predicting species extinctions (Section CCP1.2.2; Manes et al., 2021). IKLK play an important role in adaptation and are vital components of many socioecological systems, while also being threatened by climate change (high confidence) (Box 7.1) (Valdivia et al., 2010; Tengö et al., 2014; Mistry et al., 2016; Harvey et al., 2017; Diamond and Ansharyani, 2018; Camico et al., 2021)."

In the last three decades, SA has been a significant contributor to the growth of agricultural production worldwide (OECD/Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2015), driven partly by increased international demand for commodities, especially soybeans and meat (IPCC, 2019a). Between 2001 and 2015 about 65% of all forest disturbance in the region was associated with commodity-driven deforestation (Curtis et al., 2018). High rates of native vegetation conversion in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay and Peru threaten important ecosystems (Amazon, Cerrado, Chacos and Llanos savannahs, Atlantic rainforest, Caatinga and Yungas) (Graesser et al., 2015; FAO, 2016c). Almost two-thirds of soy consumed in EU+ comes from Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay (IDH, 2020), increasing conversion risk in the Amazon, Cerrado and Gran Chaco. Despite growing commodity production traceability, in 2018 only 19% of the soybean meal consumed in EU+ was certified deforestation-free and 38% compliant with the FEFAC Soy Sourcing Guidelines (IDH, 2020), which poses a serious challenge at the international level (Negra et al., 2014; Curtis et al., 2018; Lambin et al., 2018; IDH, 2020)."

These strategies also satisfy international forest and water conservation agendas in terms of optimising resources and solutions (Strassburg et al., 2019). Global conservation and sustainable development commitments, such as the Aichi Targets (Convention on Biological Diversity [CBD]), Sustainable Development Goals (UN), the NDCs under the Paris Agreement and the New York Declaration on Forests, strongly rely on nature-based solutions (NbS) to achieve their objectives (Brancalion et al., 2019) (Figure 12.12). The COVID-19 outbreak also brought attention to the need to preserve tropical forests as a means of preventing spillover of viruses from wildlife to humans, with concerns over that risk in the Amazon (Allen et al., 2017b; Dobson et al., 2020; IPBES, 2020; Ferreira et al., 2021). These represent an important opportunity for ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) to be at the core of NbS for climate change, access finance and promote climate resilient development pathways in CSA."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.1.1_p3,adaptation;ecosystem services;IUCN,"The Declaration on Protected Areas and Climate Change, presented by 18 CSA countries during the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties 21 (COP21), highlights the fundamental role of protected areas in providing the so-called GI needed to implement climate-change mitigation and adaptation and safeguard the provision of essential ecosystem services and the livelihoods of Indigenous Peoples and local communities (Gross et al., 2016). Protected area in CSA are underfunded (very high confidence). Latin American (including Mexico) governments allocate just about 1% of their national environmental budgets on protected areas (about USD 1.18 ha −1 on average). This figure only covers 54% of their basic needs, resulting in insufficient management. The financing gap to achieve optimal needs for protected areas in CSA is approximately USD 700 million yr −1 (Bovarnick et al., 2010). This seriously compromises the management and delivery capacity of protected areas for climate-change adaptation and preparedness for ongoing ecological transformation (van Kerkhoff et al., 2019). Furthermore, to become a relevant mechanism for resilience, protected areas need to be managed for this purpose (Mansourian et al., 2009). About 40% of protected areas in Latin America and the Caribbean (including Mexico) have undertaken management effectiveness evaluations (UNEP-WCMC and IUCN, 2020a). This is hardly representative of Aichi’s Target 11, although far better than the 11% global average. Collaborations with Indigenous Peoples and local communities are also an important issue to consolidate protected areas (Gross et al., 2016). In addition to protected areas as solutions for climate-change adaptation and mitigation, there is also a need to protect or restore ecosystems outside the protected areas, as illustrated by the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (Imbach et al., 2013)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.1.1_p4,adaptation,"Despite some local and specific assessments (e.g., Warner (2016)), there is a significant gap when it comes to identifying barriers to adaptation or maladaptation in the region (Dow et al., 2013). In their NCs, NDCs and/or NAPs, most countries identified inadequate financing and access to technology as barriers to adaptation relevant to terrestrial and freshwater socioecosystems (high confidence). Insufficient institutional coordination is also frequently mentioned (Rangecroft et al., 2013; Cameron et al., 2015). These limitations could be partially addressed through multi-lateral cooperation, incorporation of synergies from local to national scales, local empowerment and poverty alleviation (Rangecroft et al., 2013; Harvey et al., 2017; Murcia et al., 2017; Calispa, 2018; Chain-Guadarrama et al., 2018)."

Existing proposed measures, instruments and programmes, however, do not yet reflect the vision needed to integrate the ecosystem and human dimensions of vulnerability. Administration coordination and the progress in adaptive ecosystem management are still in their early stages, due in part to the lack of stable financial resources and scientific knowledge and IKLK about adapting ecosystems to climate change (Bustamante et al., 2020). Brazil was an exception, showing dramatic policy-driven reduction in deforestation in the Amazon between 2004–2012, with a concomitant 70% increase in soy production, the most profitable Amazon crop (Hansen et al., 2013; Nepstad et al., 2014). Policies included territorial planning (protected areas, Indigenous territories and land tenure), satellite monitoring and market and credit restrictions on high-deforesting municipalities, plus some incentives to small farmers (Boucher et al., 2013; Hansen et al., 2013; Nepstad et al., 2014; Castelo, 2015; Cunha et al., 2016a). It is important to highlight the important role of Indigenous territories, in addition to protected areas, in forest conservation in the Amazon (high evidence, medium agreement ) (Schwartzman et al., 2013; Barber et al., 2014; Nepstad et al., 2014; Walker et al., 2014b). These policies were partially funded by results-based compensation through the Amazon Fund. Since 2012, however, policies and institutions have weakened, and Amazon deforestation rates have started to rise (Carvalho et al., 2019), becoming more acute in recent years (Silva Junior et al., 2021). Conservation incentives, a new complementary and allegedly cost-effective approach, is increasingly being implemented in the region (Magrin et al., 2014). They include PES, REDD+, environmental certification and conservation easements, but remain controversial, and more research is needed on their effectiveness, possible negative side effects, participatory management systems and collective decision-making processes (Larson and Petkova, 2011; Locatelli et al., 2011; Pinho et al., 2014; Strassburg et al., 2014; Mistry et al., 2016; Gebara and Agrawal, 2017; Scarano et al., 2018; Ruggiero et al., 2019; To and Dressler, 2019; Vallet et al., 2019)."

In Chile, for example, the Eco-social Observatory of Climate Change Effects for High Altitude Wetlands of Tarapacá has been collecting information on physical, biological and social variables since 2013 (Uribe Rivera et al., 2017). Other examples in the Andes are the GLORIA-Andes network (Cuesta et al., 2017a), the Andean Forest Network (Malizia et al., 2020) and the Initiative of Hydrological Monitoring in the Andes (IMHEA), with measures to optimise watershed management and protection and reduce the risk of water insecurity (Correa et al., 2020)."

Most of the 398 ecosystem-based adaptation hotspots identified in Brazil on this premise are located in some of the ecosystems that are most vulnerable to climate change (Kasecker et al., 2018). Although conservation and restoration are reported as being effective at reducing risk (medium confidence: medium evidence, high agreement ) (Anderson et al., 2010; Borsdorf et al., 2013; Keenan, 2015; Pires et al., 2017; Ramalho et al., 2021), their effectiveness depends on the integration of conservation actions with enhancements of local socioeconomic conditions (medium confidence: medium evidence, high agreement ) (Scarano and Ceotto, 2015; Pires et al., 2017; Kasecker et al., 2018; de Siqueira et al., 2021; Vale et al., 2021)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.1.3_p3,adaptation,"Since AR5, there has been an increase in the number of adaptation measures through natural resource and ecosystem service management. The main approaches are EbA and community-based adaptation (CbA) (high confidence) (NCs, NDCs and NAPs, https://unfccc.int). IKLK can be very detailed and usually relates to people’s priorities as identified by collective decision-making (Box 7.1) (Hurlbert et al., 2019, SRCCL Section 7.6.4; SRCCL Cross-Chapter Box 13 ILK; de Coninck et al., 2018, SR1.5 Section 4.3.5.5). In Manaus, central Amazon, fishermen perceive reductions in fish size, diversity and capture levels caused by droughts, while recognising that floods hinder access to fishing grounds (Keenan, 2015; Camacho Guerreiro et al., 2016). In the Amazon floodplains, small-scale fisher and farmer communities incorporate their knowledge on natural hydrologic and ecological processes into management systems that reduce climate-change risk and impacts (Oviedo et al., 2016). Smallholder grain farmers in Guatemala and Honduras implement EbA practices based on local knowledge (e.g., live fences, home gardens, shade trees in coffee plantations, dispersed trees in corn fields and other food insecurity risk reduction practices) (Harvey et al., 2017; Chain-Guadarrama et al., 2018). There is, therefore, great potential for terrestrial and freshwater ecosystem adaptation to climate change in CSA, provided the right incentives and sociocultural protective measures are in place (high confidence) (Section 12.5.10.4; Table SM12.7)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.1.3_p4,adaptation,"Disarticulation between policy and implementation is a common problem. Ecuadorian climate public policy points towards a CbA approach, but it is often downsized when implemented (Calispa, 2018). Important adaptation actions have been undertaken in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay, both in policymaking and institutional arrangements, but they tend to be poorly coordinated with policies on development, land planning and other sectoral policies (Ryan, 2012). Some type of community participation mechanisms is present in most country strategies, but their levels of implementation vary considerably (medium confidence: medium evidence, high agreement ) (Ryan, 2012; Pires et al., 2017; Calispa, 2018)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.1.3_p5,adaptation,"There is an ecosystem bias in adaptation priorities for research and implementation, hindering the development of comprehensive adaptation programmes. Most scientific research on adaptation in Peru focuses on the highlands and coastal regions, while mitigation research focuses on forests (Chazarin et al., 2014). Combined adaptation and mitigation strategies can produce positive results, but they are often disconnected (Locatelli et al., 2015). Most reviewed cases in agriculture and forestry in Latin America (84% of 274 cases) reported positive synergies between adaptation and mitigation. Nevertheless, research on Latin American forests tend to focus on mitigation, while studies on agriculture are usually oriented towards adaptation (high confidence) (Locatelli et al., 2015, 2017)."

Adaptation strategies could benefit from integrating these and other insights from traditional cultures, fostering risk reduction and transformational adaptation towards intrinsically sustainable systems (medium confidence: medium evidence, high agreement ) (Walshe and Argumedo, 2016)."

CSA already has a greater percentage of land (24.1%) under protected status than the world average (14.7%) (UNEP-WCMC and IUCN, 2020b). Some countries, including Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Venezuela, have already met or surpassed the 30% CDB and IUCN goal (Dinerstein et al., 2019), and others, like Costa Rica and Honduras, are very close to doing so.

There is low evidence on how coastal urban areas and tourist settlements of CSA countries are adapting to SLR and extreme events (Calil et al., 2017; Villamizar et al., 2017).

In addition, MPAs in Chile play a key role in climate-change adaptation for fisheries (medium confidence) (Gelcich et al., 2015; Petit et al., 2018), and an increasing amount of funds have been invested in initiatives to reduce the vulnerability of fishery and aquaculture sectors to climate change (OECD, 2017). Since 2016, Argentina has been developing a strategy to implement EbM on fisheries with support from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) programme. Also, Argentina and Chile are promoting the local consumption of seafood and the certification of its fishery products (OECD, 2017), while Brazil and Chile have advanced in their response to climate change through the development of new research studies and methodologies incorporating research institutions (Nagy et al., 2015). Uruguay is incorporating stakeholders in its climate-change adaptation strategies (low confidence) (Nagy et al., 2015), while Colombia is supporting the capacity building of fishers, promoting livelihood diversification to increase the resilience of the sector (medium confidence: medium evidence, high agreement ) (Hellebrandt et al., 2014; Arroyo Mina et al., 2016; Matera, 2016). Chile and Peru have made certain advances in the development of guidelines for the management of the coast line and the implementation of the EbM, which has favoured the collaboration of diverse and multiple stakeholders (fishers, academics, municipal institutions), the development of outreach and educational activities, the creation of networks and the interests of other fishery communities to implement EbM (medium confidence: medium evidence, high agreement ) (Hellebrandt et al., 2014; Gelcich et al., 2015; Gutiérrez et al., 2016a; Oyanedel et al., 2016; Guerrero-Gatica et al., 2020).

There is high confidence that sandy beach ecosystems of CSA countries have suffered significant losses of dunes as a consequence of the construction of infrastructures that have caused interruptions in the natural dynamic of beaches, reducing protection against tides, waves, extreme events or tsunamis (high confidence) (Amaral et al., 2016; Bernardino et al., 2016; González and Holtmann-Ahumada, 2017; Obraczka et al., 2017).

There is medium evidence but high agreement  that the most serious barriers limiting the success of adaptation strategies in ocean and coastal systems in CSA stem from a lack of coordination (e.g., absence of participatory processes, overlapping among fishing and protection activities), lack of knowledge (e.g., poor monitoring, poor control and surveillance, no long-term studies) and lack of adequate metrics for evaluating adaptation actions informing decision makers hinder the continuity and adjustment of measures and lead to weak governance (e.g., perverse incentives, resource overexploitation, conflicts), a lack of financial resources and long-term commitments (e.g., crisis, lack of budgets, market fluctuations), weak policies, cultural constraints, poverty, low flexibility, lack of awareness of climate risks and lack of engagement by stakeholders (Leal Filho, 2018; Nagy et al., 2019; Moreno et al., 2020b; Aburto et al., 2021)."

In another context, IKLK has been considered for the evaluation of water scarcity and GLOF risks in Peru (NWS) (Motschmann et al., 2020b). Additionally, local citizen science-based initiatives (Buytaert et al., 2014; Tellman et al., 2016; Njue et al., 2019) can support the production of multiple forms of knowledge with flexible and extensive data collection. Important questions centre around how to integrate IKLK and other types of knowledge from the early planning stages on, to achieve enhanced or transformational adaptation building on co-produced knowledge (Kates et al., 2012; Klenk et al., 2017).

This first glacier law in the world represents a milestone for high-mountain conservation but is also criticised for hindering effective disaster risk adaptation measures and excluding local socioeconomic needs (Anacona et al., 2018). Furthermore, the first Framework Law on Climate Change was implemented in Peru (2018) and is under way in Colombia, Chile and Venezuela (Figure 12.13; Table SM12.6). Overarching regional institutions (e.g., OAS [2016])  and most countries in CSA promote a move towards more integrative and sustainable management of water resources through new legislation and financing mechanisms. For instance, new water laws that include principles of integrated water resource management (IWRM) have entered into force, for example, in Nicaragua (2007), Peru (2009), Ecuador (2014) and Costa Rica (2014), or are under way, such as in Colombia (since 2009).

This share drops down to less than 50% in NSA (Venezuela) and SES (Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay), except for Panama in CA, which allocates more than 75% of the required financial resources. For the implementation of NbS, evidence suggests that the overall expenditure remains well below 1% of total investment in water resource management infrastructure (WWAP, 2018). These funding deficits set important limitations on future water provision, adaptation to changing water resources and the achievement of the SDGs by 2030 (high confidence) (WHO, 2017)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.3.4_p1,adaptation,"Although a growing body of adaptation initiatives exists for CSA, evidence on their effectiveness is scarce. In many parts of CSA the level of success of adaptation measures depends largely on the governance of projects and stakeholder-based processes and is closely related to their effectiveness, efficiency, social equity and sociopolitical legitimacy (high confidence) (Adger et al., 2005; Rasmussen, 2016b; Moulton et al., 2021). Several PES experiences across CSA have been described as successful measures for watershed conservation and adaptation (high confidence). An example of success is the Quito water fund in Ecuador, which aims to improve the city’s water quality by integrating public and private stakeholder interests with ecosystem conservation and local community development since the 2000s (Bremer et al., 2016; Grima et al., 2016) (Case Study 12.6.1). At the same time, in Moyobamba in Peru, the development of a watershed protection programme was leveraged by a multi-stakeholder platform process that enabled deep social learning (Lindsay, 2018). In turn, initiatives that do not consider the entire set of social-ecological dimensions and dynamics of adaptation or unintentionally increase vulnerabilities of human or natural systems are at risk of leading to reduced outcomes (McDowell et al., 2021) or maladaptation (Reid et al., 2018; McDowell et al., 2019; Eriksen et al., 2021). However, systematic assessments of maladaptation in the water sector have barely been provided for CSA."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.3.4_p2,adaptation,"In CSA, only limited information on the limits of adaptation in relation to water is available, for instance on the possible path dependency of institutions and associated resistance to change (Barnett et al., 2015). Examples of soft adaptation limits (i.e., options to avoid intolerable risks currently not available) include lack of trust and stakeholder flexibility, associated with unequal power relations that lead to reduced social learning and poor outcomes for improved water management, as reported in, for example, NWS (Lindsay, 2018). An example of hard adaptation limits (i.e., intolerable risks cannot be avoided) in the region is the loss of livelihoods and cultural values associated with glacier shrinkage in NWS (Jurt et al., 2015)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.3.4_p3,adaptation,"Most barriers to advance adaptation in CSA correspond to soft limits associated with missing links of science–society–policy processes, institutional fragilities, pronounced hierarchies, unequal power relations and top-down water governance regimes (high confidence). One example is the abandonment of long-term hydrological monitoring sites within tropical Andean ecosystems (paramo) in Venezuela (Rodríguez-Morales et al., 2019) due to the lack of governmental support during the political crisis. In that regard, the collection and availability of consistent hydroclimatic and socioeconomic data at adequate scales represent an important challenge in CSA. Major adaptation barriers are furthermore reported from central Chile in the context of a mega-drought since 2010, related to socioeconomic factors and a deficient bottom-up approach to informing and developing public policy (Aldunce et al., 2017). These gaps could be bridged by strengthening transdisciplinary approaches at the science–policy interface (Lillo-Ortega et al., 2019) with blended bottom-up and top-down adaptation to include scientific knowledge with impact and scenario assessments in local adaptation agendas (Huggel et al., 2015b). For instance, a new allocation rule for the Laja reservoir in southern Chile (SWS), based on consistent water balance modelling results, could inform policy and water management and potentially improve local water management and reduce water conflicts over the long term (Muñoz et al., 2019b)."

Drought conditions in CA and the Caribbean increased in line with climate model predictions (Herrera et al., 2018a). The direct social and economic consequences for the sector are evident in CA’s so-called Dry Corridor, with a growing dependence on food imports (Porkka et al., 2013), and these degrees of dependency make the region more vulnerable to price variability, climatic conditions (Bren d’Amour et al., 2016; ECLAC, 2018) and, therefore, to food insecurity in the absence of adaptation actions (high confidence) (Porkka et al., 2013; Bren d’Amour et al., 2016; López Feldman and Hernández Cortés, 2016; Eitzinger et al., 2017; Imbach et al., 2017; Lachaud et al., 2017; Harvey et al., 2018; Niles and Salerno, 2018; del Pozo et al., 2019; Alpízar et al., 2020; Anaya et al., 2020)."

CSA agriculture has a diversity of systems and segments of producers. While small-scale farmers contribute significantly to food production and food security, especially in developing economies, they face global policies oriented towards global commodity markets (Knapp, 2017; Fernández et al., 2019). Climate action initiatives that consider CSA’s high levels of poverty and inequality to reduce these pervasive problems are central for adaptation in the region (Crumpler et al., 2020; Locatelli et al., 2020)."

Solutions that consider relevant drivers that have demonstrated a positive effect in diffusion of adaptation strategies are more efficient (Table 12.8). Some conditions, such as the promotion of education programmes, participation in cooperatives, credit access and land tenure security, can help. In the same line, in CSA some elements, such as technology and information access and local knowledge, reinforce climate-change adaptation (Khatri-Chhetri et al., 2019; Piggott-McKellar et al., 2019). As stated in Table 12.8, barriers of various origins persist in connection with climate-change adaptation in the region increasing the vulnerability of farming systems and rural livelihoods."

Such services should address the challenges of ensuring that climate information and advisory services are relevant to the decisions of smallholder and family farmers, providing timely climate service access to remote rural communities with marginal infrastructure and ensuring that farmers own climate services and shape their design and delivery. An interesting case facing this gap is the implementation of local technical agro-climatic committees in Colombia, which make it possible to share and validate climatic and weather forecasts, as well as crop model results for seasonal drought events (Loboguerrero et al., 2018). Another example is the web service AdaptaBrasil-MCTI, which forecasts the risk of climate-change impacts on strategic sectors (e.g., food, energy, water) in Brazil (Government of Brazil and Ministry of Science Technology and Innovation Secretariat of Policies and Programs, 2021)."

In 2014, the penetration rate of this type of insurance in the region averaged 0.03% of GDP, and a few countries dominate the market (Brazil, Argentina). Beyond these countries, some initiatives also exist in Uruguay, Paraguay, Chile and Ecuador. In most Latin American and Caribbean countries, the public sector plays an important role in providing insurance or reinsurance and coexists with private-sector companies (Cárdenas et al., 2021). Insurance protections represent a strategy to transfer climate risk to protect the well-being of vulnerable small farmers and accelerate uptake (recovery) after a climate-related extreme weather event.

In turn, these factors compromise productivity and competitiveness. Support for the rural poor can be focused on both economic competitiveness and social development. Finally, to align the identified adaptation options as a priority for achieving future food security in the NDCs of CSA countries to mitigation commitments, it will be essential to highlight synergies by generating evidence (national research) in relation to progress towards increasing productivity and resilience and reducing GHG, in addition to demonstrating its added value as a development initiative (Rudel et al., 2015 sustainable; Loboguerrero et al., 2019)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.4.3_p1,adaptation,"To contextualise the adaptation options at the regional level, the majority of the NDCs of the CSA countries reported observed and/or projected climate-related hazards: occurrence of droughts and floods (80% of countries each), followed by storms (45%) and landslides (30%), as well as extreme heat, wildfire and invasion by pests and non-native species in agriculture (25% each) (Crumpler et al., 2020)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.4.3_p2,adaptation,"The main adaptation options for climate change in the region include preventive measures against soil erosion; climate-smart agriculture, which provides a framework for synergies between adaptation, mitigation and improved food security; climate information systems; land use planning; shifting plantations at high altitudes to avoid temperature increases and plagues; and improved varieties of pastures and cattle (Lee et al., 2014; Jat et al., 2016; Crumpler et al., 2020; Moreno et al., 2020a; Aragón et al., 2021). Agricultural technologies are not necessarily changing, but the economic activity is shifting to accommodate increasing climate variation and adapt to changes in water availability and ideal growing conditions (high confidence), as is observed in Argentina, Colombia and Brazil (McMartin et al., 2018; Rolla et al., 2018; Sloat et al., 2020; Gori Maia et al., 2021). Coffee plantations are moving further up mountain regions, with the land at lower elevations converted for other uses. In Brazil, crop modelling suggests the need for the development of new cultivars, with a longer crop cycle and with higher tolerance to high temperatures, a necessary technological advance for maize, an essential staple crop, to be produced in the future. Additionally, irrigation becomes essential for sustaining productivity in adverse climate-change scenarios in several regions of CSA (McMartin et al., 2018; Lyons, 2019; Reay, 2019)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.4.3_p3,adaptation;carbon sequestration,"Livestock production is for small farmers one of the main sources of protein and contributes to food security (Rodríguez et al., 2016). The importance of this sub-sector in CSA will continue to increase as the demand for meat products does as well in the coming years, driven by growing incomes in the region (OECD and FAO, 2019). However, the increase in animal production has been associated with land degradation, triggered by the conversion of native vegetation to pastureland and aggravated by overgrazing and abandoning of the degraded pastures (Baumann et al., 2017; ECLAC, 2018; Müller-Hansen et al., 2019). Sá et al. (2017) simulated the adoption of agricultural systems based on LCA strategies towards 2050. According to the simulation, the adoption of LCA strategies in the SA region can alter the growing trend of land use and land use change emissions, and at the same time, it can increase meat production by 55 Mt for the entire period (2016–2050). The restoration of degraded pasture and livestock intensification account for 71.2% and integrated crop–livestock–forestry system contributes 28.8% of total meat production for the entire period. These results indicate that combined actions in agricultural management systems in SA can result in synergistic responses that can be used to make agriculture and livestock production an important part of the solution of global climate change and advance food security (medium confidence: insufficient evidence and high agreement ) (Zu Ermgassen et al., 2018; Pompeu et al., 2021). Crop–livestock–forestry systems are also important for climate-change adaptation as they provide multiple benefits, including the coproduction of food, animal feed, organic fertilizers and soil organic carbon sequestration (Sharma et al., 2016; Rodríguez et al., 2021), achieving mitigation and adaptation goals (high confidence) (Picasso et al., 2014; Modernel et al., 2016, 2019; Rolla et al., 2019; Locatelli et al., 2020). A recent analysis of agroforestry in Brazil showed positive and relevant impacts on the heads/pasture area rate in livestock production and that the system may have also stimulated a shift towards other production activities with higher gross added value (Gori Maia et al., 2021). Agroforestry has also proven to have protective benefits to obtain more stable, less fluctuating yields due to climate-related damage in coffee production (high confidence) (Bacon et al., 2017; Durand-Bessart et al., 2020; Ovalle-Rivera et al., 2020). In the same way, the production of plant-based fibre can be less vulnerable to economic and climatic variability through farming system diversification. Textile fibre crops for the case of cotton include crop rotation, agroecological intercropping and agroforestry (Oliveira Duarte et al., 2019)."

Over 20% of the urban population in Latin America and the Caribbean live in slums and many other forms of precarious and segregated neighbourhoods, settled in risk areas and lacking infrastructure (Rasch, 2017; UN-Habitat, 2018; Rojas, 2019). This vulnerable condition is boosted by unstable political and governmental institutions, which suffer from ongoing corruption, weak governance and reduced capacity to finance adaptation (Rasch, 2016). Facing governance challenges by including diverse stakeholders and encouraging and learning from community-based experiences has also presented the opportunity to improve adaptation strategies (Archer et al., 2014).

An integrated climate–health surveillance system for vector-borne disease control was developed in southern coastal Ecuador through a partnership among the climate and health sectors and academia (Borbor-Cordova et al., 2016; Lowe et al., 2017). Additionally, an interdisciplinary multi-national team working at the border of Ecuador and Peru created a cooperation network for climate-informed dengue surveillance (Quichi et al., 2016), and their successful binational collaboration resulted in the local elimination of malaria (Krisher et al., 2016).

However, deforestation and malaria have a complex relationship that relies on local context interactions, where land use and land cover changes play an important role due to vector ecology alterations and social conditions of human settlements (Rubio-Palis et al., 2013). Forest conservation can improve hydrological cycle control and soil erosion that can help to improve water quality and reduce the burden of water-borne diseases. In addition, forest cover can help to diminish the habitat for larval mosquitoes that transmit malaria. These measures can help to design policies at sites where these problems do not currently exist but can emerge as a consequence of climate change and the increase in the frequency of weather extreme events."

A recent systematic review of epidemic forecasting and prediction studies found that no reporting guidelines exist; the development of guidance to improve the transparency, quality and implementation of forecast models in the public health sector was recommended (Pollett et al., 2020). An earlier review of dengue early-warning models found that few models incorporated both spatial and temporal aspects of disease risk (Racloz et al., 2012), limiting their potential application as an adaptation strategy by the health sector.

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.8.1_p3,adaptation,"Because there are asymmetries among populations regarding the vulnerability and benefits of adaptation, along the lines of gender, age, socioeconomic conditions and ethnicity, it has been noticed that adaptation policies and programmes must be adequate to diverse conditions and actors (very high confidence) (Kaijser and Kronsell, 2014; Walshe and Argumedo, 2016; Baucom and Omelsky, 2017; Harvey et al., 2018)."

The participation of experts, communities and citizens has shown to be effective (FAO and Fundación Futuro Latinoamericano, 2019), particularly through partnerships between grassroots organisations and impoverished communities, providing valued expertise and capacities to support the implementation of government climate resilience strategies (World Bank Group, 2015). More inclusive planning processes correspond to higher climate equity and justice outcomes in the short term, but an emphasis on building dedicated multi-sector governance institutions may also enhance long-term programmes’ stability while ensuring civil society has a voice in adaptation planning and implementation (Chu et al., 2016). Some local organisations and people have succeeded when they were in charge of their own resiliency efforts, where international projects and protocols proved less effective (Doughty, 2016). Some decentralised governmental programmes have tried to increase public responsiveness to the adaptation needs of the people, but such programmes have proven to be only mildly successful and provoke the mobilisation of communities against existing governance structures (Thompson, 2016)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.8.1_p5,adaptation,"IKLK participation is thought to be more considered in adaptation policies because it yields good results (high confidence) (Nagy et al., 2014b; Jurt et al., 2015; Arias et al., 2016; Stensrud, 2016). IK has been adaptive for long periods in the Andes (Cuvi, 2018), but there might be limits to adaptation in the face of present climatic and other environmental and socioeconomic drivers (Postigo, 2019). Approaches integrating IK with more formal sciences, to address research and policies, have improved adaptation processes, but they carry their own complications (high confidence) (Doswald et al., 2014; Metternicht et al., 2014; Tengö et al., 2014; Drenkhan et al., 2015; Keenan, 2015; Lasage et al., 2015; Camacho Guerreiro et al., 2016; Hurlbert and Gupta, 2016; Roco et al., 2016; Santos et al., 2016; Walshe and Argumedo, 2016; Uribe Rivera et al., 2017; Kasecker et al., 2018; Cuesta et al., 2019; Ulloa, 2019; Ariza-Montobbio and Cuvi, 2020). More interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research will help to better understand and manage the relationships among governance, implementation, management priorities, wealth distribution and trade-offs between adaptation, mitigation and the SDGs."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.8.1_p7,adaptation,"Many social movements address adaptation to climate change. Some engage and participate in policy and planning, often producing good results at the local level. In contrast, top-down approaches without citizen or community participation have shown to be less effective (high confidence) (Krellenberg and Katrin, 2014; Nagy et al., 2014b; Stein and Moser, 2014; Ruiz-Mallén et al., 2015; Sherman et al., 2015; Waylen et al., 2015; Bizikova et al., 2016; Chelleri et al., 2016; Merlinsky, 2016; Villamizar et al., 2017)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.8.3_p1,adaptation,"There is ample empirical evidence that the impacts of climate change are not of equal scope for men and women. Women, particularly the poorest, are more vulnerable and are impacted in greater proportion. Often, for several economic and social reasons, women have less capacity to adapt, further widening structural gender gaps (high confidence) (Box 7.4; Arana Zegarra, 2017; Casas Varez, 2017; Segnestam, 2017; Acosta et al., 2019; Aldunce Ide et al., 2020; Olivera et al., 2021; Silva Rodríguez de San Miguel et al., 2021). Gender equity is deemed to be central to discussions on climate-change adaptation policies. In issues such as drinking water, energy, disasters, impacts on health and agriculture and capacity to migrate, women (poor women in particular) are affected in greater proportion, further widening structural gender gaps. In a rural community vulnerable to drought, short-term coping was more common among the women, especially among female heads of household, while adaptive actions were more common among the men; there are gendered inequalities in access to and control over different forms of capital that lead to a gender-differentiated capacity to adapt, where men are better able to adapt and women experience a downward spiral in their capacity to adapt and increasing vulnerability to drought (Segnestam, 2017)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.8.3_p2,adaptation,"However, women are not always the more vulnerable group. While in a broad sense climate-change impacts women more severely, there are situations where they have reacted, adapted better to or been more resilient. Grassroots women self-help groups can be active agents of change for their communities, designing and delivering gender-responsive adaptation solutions (Huairou Commission, 2019). Some studies suggest that women establish friendlier relationships with the environment and towards natural resources; studies on masculinity and environment confirm this tendency (Brough et al., 2016). In a multi-country study, some female-headed households tend to be slightly less vulnerable and more resilient than male-headed households, though some exceptions were found among sub-groups (Andersen et al., 2017). In Chile, women are more likely to modernise irrigation and infrastructure, and gender appears to be an important element in drought adaptation (Roco et al., 2016). A change to agroecological practices has improved gender equality and adaptive capacity to climate change (Cáceres-Arteaga et al., 2020)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.8.3_p3,adaptation,"Recent studies emphasise that a gender approach to social inequalities ought to move beyond just looking at men and women as experiencing impacts in a differentiated manner; rather, an intersectional analysis illuminates how different individuals and groups relate differently to climate change due to their situatedness in power structures based on context-specific and dynamic social categorisations (high confidence) (Kaijser and Kronsell, 2014; Djoudi et al., 2016; Thompson-Hall et al., 2016; Olivera et al., 2021). Thus, the relationship between gender and adaptation demands an analytical framework that connects environmental problems with social inequalities in a complex way (Godfrey, 2012). An intersectional approach helps to better capture the diversity of adaptive strategies that men and women adopt vis-à-vis climate change. Particular constellations of race, gender, class, age or nationality reveal more complex realities (high confidence)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.8.4_p2,adaptation;Capacity building,"These processes can be interpreted as impacts on vulnerable peoples, but also as adaptation strategies to manage risks and reduce exposure when people continue with their lives, temporarily or permanently, in a different but stable situationor when family members send remittances to those that remain in the affected areas (Section 7.4.3.2; Cross-Chapter Box MIGRATE in Chapter 7). The remittances create opportunities for adaptive capacity building because they reduce some vulnerabilities in the form of infrastructures, agricultural supplies, food, education or health, as in northern CA (NU CEPAL, 2018). Anyhow, migration as adaptation is not available to everyone (Kaenzig and Piguet, 2014), and the idea has also been contested because it may not help to overcome structural problems or point to in situ options (Radel et al., 2018; Ruiz-de-Oña et al., 2019). The causal processes are complex. Surveys of migrants usually find that the main reported reason for migration is to find a job or to increase household income (Wrathall and Suckall, 2016; OIM, 2017; Radel et al., 2018), but the underlying reason for the lack of a job or income is rarely examined and at times may be related to climatic hazards."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.8.4_p4,adaptation,"Migration to cities can mean opportunities for migrants and for urban areas, but it can also worsen existing problems, as urban poor people can become even more exposed and vulnerable, and the pressure on urban capacities may not be well absorbed (high confidence) (Chisari and Miller, 2016; Gemenne et al., 2020). Internal migration to cities is likely to exacerbate pre-existing vulnerabilities related to inequality, poverty, indigence and informal activities and housing (Warn and Adamo, 2014). Immigration can make cities/residents more vulnerable to climate-change risks (Sections 12.5.5 and 12.5.7). Groups such as children, Indigenous Peoples and the poor are usually among the most vulnerable in migrations and displacements, which poses challenges to national policies and international aid (Sedeh, 2014; Gamez, 2016; Ulla, 2016; Priotto and Salvador Aruj, 2017; Ramos and de Salles Cavedon-Capdeville, 2017; Amar-Amar et al., 2019; Gemenne et al., 2020). In migration or displacement driven by climate effects, women are prone to lose their leadership, autonomy and voice, especially in new organisational structures imposed by authorities. This is especially the case in temporary accommodation camps created after disasters, exacerbating existing differentiated vulnerabilities (Aldunce Ide et al., 2020). International migration has become more dangerous and difficult as border controls have become stricter, but programmes such as one to help temporary agricultural workers from Guatemala to Canada have proven successful (Gabriel and Macdonald, 2018). At the same time, emigration may lead to the loss of IKLK for adaptation (Moreno et al., 2020b)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.8.5_p1,adaptation,"Climate-change financing is unequally distributed among CSA countries (high confidence). Financing of climate-change adaptation remains very much delegated to multilateral and bilateral cooperation, and the governments in the region have heavily relied on it. Still, there are some concerns regarding justice in the distribution of these funds (Khan et al., 2020). The UNFCCC has created financing mechanisms throughout its functioning years, but a wide range of issues that present challenges for access by recipients (Hickmann et al., 2019). These include a lack of technical capacity, difficulties in following the procedures established by the various financial entities and low levels of awareness about the need for action, as well as the different sources of funds available. The fiscal policies of various countries have contributed to government financing in the fight against climate change (World Bank, 2021). Since the Paris Agreement, countries have pledged NDCs that introduce the need to design and implement carbon budgets with a corresponding consideration of the efficiency and costs and benefits involved in each mitigation or adaptation to climate-change projects (Fragkos, 2020)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.8.5_p2,adaptation,"According to UNFCCC, Latin America and the Caribbean, for the period 2015–2016, obtained 22% of climate financing from multilateral climate funds. In this section we use data fromhttps://climatefundsupdate.org/data-dashboard, and most of the reported information for Latin American and the Caribbean includes Mexico, since the scope of this chapter does not include Mexico, so we must rely on the raw data included in the data dashboard mentioned in the link (see also Guzmán et al. [2016]). According to the data, 76% of climate-related financing went to mitigation projects, with the remaining 24% going to adaptation. Of the total financing provided by the multilateral climate funds to the region, 51% took the form of concessional loans, while 47% was provided as grants. For the region, approvals in the 2015–2016 period were concentrated in Argentina, Chile, Brazil and Colombia, where large-scale mitigation projects were launched supported by the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the Clean Technology Fund (CTF). For the period 2003–2019, the total contribution of climate financing to SA and the Caribbean is about USD 3558 million. The largest contributors to climate financing in the region come from the GCF, which approved USD 824.2 million for 23 projects. Brazil is the top recipient with USD 195 million, followed by Argentina with about USD 162 million. The second provider is the Amazon Fund with USD 717 million allocated to 102 projects in Brazil. In 2018, the CTF became the third largest source of financing, with USD 483 million dollars approved for 24 projects; the main recipient is Chile with USD 16,207 million, followed by Colombia with USD 170 million. The five largest projects approved in the region in 2018 were through the GCF. Brazil (USD 195 million) received support for reducing energy consumption across Brazilian cities, while Argentina (USD 103 million) received support to scale up investments by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in renewable energy and energy efficiency. In both cases, financing is predominantly provided as concessional loans."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.8.5_p3,adaptation,"Climate financing in CSA is mainly focused on mitigation actions (high confidence). In SA and the Caribbean, 73% (USD 2579 million) of funding to date has supported mitigation. Only 21% (USD 761 million) of the funding supports adaptation projects, and the remaining 4% (USD 217 million) supports multi-focus projects. Of the 51 new projects in SA and the Caribbean approved in 2018–2019, the GCF financed USD 508 million over ten projects. Amazon Fund was next with USD 81 million for 10 projects. While the GCF focuses on large and transformative projects and programmes, and in connection with broader reform of the policy framework in the region, the Amazon Fund targets smaller project interventions."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.8.5_p4,adaptation,"Climate financing in the region is concentrated in Brazil, which receives a third of the region’s funding, with 41 mitigation activities receiving more than 6 times that of adaptation from multilateral climate funds. By the size of its GDP, Brazil receives the largest amount of financing; this leaves the poorest countries with little or no financing and therefore reinforces a vicious circle of poverty and vulnerability. Whether this is due to Brazil’s being more successful at presenting eligible projects, a lack of commitment from other developing countries or some other structural factors is an open question. In any case, compensation schemes for the most vulnerable countries appear as needed, given the differences in vulnerability to climate-related damage (Antimiani et al., 2017). This is aggravated by the fact that fund management is in the hands of supranational entities while inequalities remain in regions within a country, particularly in highly centralised countries, as is the case for countries in the region."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.5.8.5_p5,adaptation,"COVID-19 recovery plans can have synergistic effects for climate-change adaptation (medium confidence: low evidence, high agreement ). A key decision point for adaptation will be how the world responds to the pandemic. The global recovery can serve as a catalyst to increased and more equitable climate financing. Globally, recovery packages will likely have the power to change the global trajectory towards meeting the targets of the Paris Agreement and building a more just future (Forster et al., 2020). Several factors are relevant to the design of economic recovery packages: the long-run economic multiplier, contributions to the productive asset base and national wealth, speed of implementation, affordability, simplicity, impact on inequality and various political considerations (Hepburn et al., 2020). A key objective of any recovery package is to stabilise expectations, restore confidence and channel desired surplus savings into productive investment. However, ‘business as usual’ implies temperature increases over 3°C, implying great future uncertainty, instability and climate damage. An alternative way to restore confidence is to steer investment towards a productive and balanced portfolio of sustainable physical capital, human capital, social capital, intangible capital and natural capital assets (Zenghelis et al., 2020), consistent with global goals on climate change. Finally, any recovery package, including climate-friendly recovery, is unlikely to be implemented unless it also addresses existing societal and political concerns—such as poverty alleviation, inequality and social inclusion—which vary from country to country."

The law defines local government mandates on local climate action plans.

The number of publications is not representative of the sensitivity to climate change and vulnerability contexts of different sub-regions and sectors. This lack of representation in the mainstream literature may lead to a bias and, therefore, an underestimation of the overall climate-related impact for some CSA sub-regions (Sietsma et al., 2021). The reason for the relatively few quantitative studies might be the complexities of socio-demographic and economic factors and the lack of long-term and reliable data in these areas (Harvey et al., 2018), along with other social, economic and technical constraints."

SES is the most urbanised sub-region of CSA, but there are severe knowledge deficits related to the design, implementation and evaluation of adaptation policy plans with respect to climate change. Forecasts related to risk prevention require new studies that address down-scaled climate-change models with concrete solutions to increase cities’ resilience. In SWS, there is a lack of long-term studies addressing climate-change impacts on terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems, which is mainly due to the lack of integrated observational systems. There is a lack of studies projecting future impacts of climate change on the cryosphere, water resources, hazards, risks and disasters on natural and human systems. This is mainly due to the lack of systematic documentation, analysis and evaluation of adaptation strategies adopted, as well as their limitations and the lessons learned from maladaptation processes. There is scant evidence about transformational adaptation to climate change and system resilience. In SSA, there is a need for information related to the cities’ vulnerability to climate change and the impacts of the direct effects of future climate change on cities, energy infrastructure and health.

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.7.2.1_p1,adaptation;feedback,"Advances in scientific knowledge on the risks of climate-change impacts and the vulnerability and resilience of ecosystems to climate change are needed (Bustamante et al., 2020). Persistent climate change in tropical rainforests requires deeper study and understanding, overall in connection with the role of nutrients, deep-water availability and biodiversity. Further research is needed to understand feedback to climate systems of large-scale changes in the land surface in SA biomes. The region has important freshwater Global 200 Ecoregions, including the Orinoco River and Flooded Forests, Upper Amazon River and streams, and Amazon River and Flooded Forests, which represent a priority for freshwater biodiversity conservation at a global scale (Manes et al., 2021) (Cross-Chapter Paper 1; Figure 12.8). There is, however, a clear knowledge gap on the impacts of climate change on freshwater biodiversity in the region (Section CCP1.2.3; Manes et al., 2021). Lastly, more interdisciplinary research is needed regarding conservation strategies and stable financial resources focusing on adaptation of ecosystems in the region (Mistry et al., 2016; Gebara and Agrawal, 2017; Ruggiero et al., 2019; To and Dressler, 2019)."

Poor or absent monitoring programmes (physical, environmental and biological variables) that feed alert and surveillance systems are lacking in CSA. There is a general absence of a continuous line of scientific research or adequate baseline information about the impacts of climate change, as well as continuous monitoring of the adaptation plans adopted in ocean and coastal ecosystems that limit the formulation of adequate conservation and management programmes. When studies are performed, inadequate access to data limits the analyses of the existing information, making difficult to detect climate-change trends and impacts and develop effective adaptation strategies."

Limited information regarding cost-benefit analyses of adaptation in the food production sector is available in the region. It is also important to obtain a better understanding of adaptation effects to avoid maladaptation and promote site-specific and dynamic adaptation options considering available technologies. Compiling and systematising existing scientific and local knowledge on the relationship between forests, land cover/use and hydrological services is a gap that must be filled from a broader perspective in the region, which could contribute to formulating recommendations and inform restoration practices and policies. The literature also highlights widespread gaps between farmers’ information needs and services that are routinely available. There is evidence that when climate information services are created with farmer input and targeted in a timely and inclusive manner, they are a positive determinant of adaptation through the adoption of more resilient farm-level practices. However, current assessments of the economic impacts of climate information services are scarce; hence, more such studies are needed."

This issue is particularly relevant to medium-sized cities because most of the literature and data available on adaptation refer to the major capital cities. The potential of applying new resilient parameters in building and land use regulations for adaptation is underreported. The same can be said about the impact of housing improvement and slum upgrading on climate resilience, even when initiatives are focused on reducing environmental and climate risk. Also relevant in the region is a gap in research about NbS applied to urban area adaptation, as in the case of the urban forestry potential for adaptation (Barona et al., 2020). Even though the importance of urban ecological infrastructure in providing ecosystem services, such as flood control, is reasonably well documented, its practical application in urban planning in CSA remains limited (Romero-Duque et al., 2020). Added to this is the lack of monitoring data on adaptation initiatives in general and, in particular, on adaptation initiatives in water systems that have already been implemented and their effects on risk reduction. A lack of monitoring data contributes to the lack of information about maladaptation in urban areas and its consequences. Mobility and transport system adaptation options remained virtually entirely unexplored, while mitigation options receive significant attention."

Little connection is found in research concentrating on resistance to climate-change adaptation policies and their interaction with the politics of place. Conflictivity related to climate change is another understudied issue."

A salient knowledge gap in this thematic area is the need to characterise how multi-level and multi-actor governance systems can enable sustainable land management practices, including ecosystem restoration (Mathez-Stiefel et al., 2017). More capacities are needed to increase the generation of relevant knowledge. Even small grant programmes can sustain research projects that target the linkages between knowledge and decision-making at multiple scales (Báez et al., 2020)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.8_p1,adaptation,"CSA is a broadly heterogeneous region with respect to topography, ecosystems, urban and rural territories, demography, economy, cultures and climates. The region relies on a strong agrarian economy in which small producers and large industries participate, but also large industrialised urban centres, oil production and mining. The region is one of the most urbanised areas of the world and home to many Indigenous Peoples, some still in isolation, and exhibits one of the highest rates of inequality, which is a structural and growing feature of CSA. Poverty and extreme poverty rates are higher among children, young people, women, Indigenous Peoples and migrant and rural populations, but urban extreme poverty is also growing (very high confidence). Socioeconomic challenges are being intensified by the COVID crisis. Most countries in CA are already ranked as the highest risk level worldwide due to the region’s high vulnerability to climate change and low adaptive capacity; the lack of climate data and proper downscaling are challenging the adaptation process (high confidence)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.8_p4,adaptation,"Extreme heat, droughts and floods will seriously affect CSA terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. The high poverty level increases the region’s vulnerability to droughts, both in cities and rural areas, where people already suffer from natural water scarcity (high confidence). The conversion of natural ecosystems to other land uses exacerbates the adaptation challenges. IKLK play an important role in adaptation but are also threatened by climate change (high confidence). EbA and CbA have increased since AR5, with an emphasis on freshwater ecosystems and forests, including protected areas. Inadequate access to finance and technology is widely identified as an adaptation barrier (high confidence)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.8_p6,adaptation,"The common patterns and problems, however, also highlight the possibilities for collaboration and learning among the countries and institutions in the region in order to strengthen the interface between knowledge and policy in climate-change adaptation.

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.8_p7,adaptation,"Various adaptation initiatives have been launched in various sectors that focus on reducing poverty, improving livelihoods and achieving sustainable and resilient development. An increasing number of planned and autonomous initiatives has been seen, led by communities, governments or a combination of the two, involving engineering or NbS. Climate-smart agriculture is an effective option, in several conditions and regions, to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change. Disaster reduction solutions are increasingly being used, such as EWSs. Many and diverse initiatives are still poorly reported and evaluated in the scientific literature, leading to challenges in assessing and improving them, including consideration of tacit IKLK. The lack of climate data and proper downscaling, weak governance, obstacles to financing, and inequality constrain the adaptation process (high confidence)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.8_p8,adaptation,"Adaptation measures have been increased and improved since AR5 in ocean and coastal ecosystems. The majority of these measures are focused on EbA application through the application of protection and recovery of already impacted ecosystems. Another battery of measures is focused on the management and sustainability of marine resources managed in fisheries; however, these measures do not assess current and future climate-change impacts but rather focus on decreasing the impact of other non-climate factors, such as overfishing or pollution. To date, throughout CSA there is an important lack of long-term research addressing ocean and coastal ecosystem health and their species through continuous monitoring, which is one of the main barriers to adaptation. The number and type of adaptation measures for ocean and coastal ecosystems and their contributions to humans are very different among CSA countries, which highlights the number of measures related to increasing scientific research and monitoring followed by the conservation of biodiversity and changes in legislation (high confidence). On the other hand, those measures that include changes in financing (an important barrier) or the incorporation of traditional knowledge are not always considered in NAPs by CSA countries."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.8_p9,adaptation,"In the water sector, a lack of systematic analysis and evaluation of adaptation measures predominates, although important progress has been made since AR5 in terms of understanding the interlinkages among climate change, human vulnerabilities, governance, policies and adaptation success (high confidence).

Adaptation has taken place throughout the region in planning, land use and building regulation, urban control systems and risk management. Initiatives in social housing focus on reducing risk and overcoming urgent deficits but also adding to a transformative adaptation pathway (high confidence). Hybrid (green-grey) infrastructure has been adopted for better efficiency in flood control, sanitation, water scarcity and landslide prevention and coastal protection (high confidence). NbS, including GI and EbA, are increasing in urban areas (high confidence), although isolated engineering solutions are still widely practiced.

It is widely recognised that climate adaptation measures, if carefully selected considering coupled human-environment systems, will provide significant contributions to the sustainable development pathways of the region and to achieve the SDGs if implemented together with comprehensive strategies to reduce poverty, inequality and risks (high confidence). Adaptation and the construction of resilience offer not only an opportunity to reduce climate-change impacts but also an opportunity to reduce inequality and development gaps, to achieve dynamic economies and to regulate the sustainable use and transformation of the territory."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#FAQ 12.1_p7,adaptation,"Inequality, informality and precariousness are particularly relevant barriers to adaptation. A significant part of the construction sector in the region is informal and does not follow regulations for land use and construction safety codes, and there is a lack of public strategies for housing access. Adaptive construction is based on up-to-date regulation and codes, appropriate design and materials, and access to infrastructure and services. Decreasing inequality and eradicating poverty are crucial for achieving proper adaptation to climate change in the region. Some anti-poverty initiatives, such as savings groups, microfinance for improving housing or assets and community enterprises, may also support specific adaptive measures. These mechanisms should be widely accessible to poor groups and be complemented by comprehensive poverty alleviation programmes that include climate-change adaptation."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#FAQ 12.2_p9,adaptation,"Despite consistent political and economic barriers, many cities in the region have adopted sustainable local development agendas, which work to bring about balanced urban development. The shortcomings of poor development patterns remain prominently on display in cities and present important obstacles to adaptation investment, as public investment in basic needs (mainly housing and sanitation) must be prioritised."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#FAQ 12.2_p10,adaptation,"Cities struggle to address the immediate needs of their population while addressing longer-term needs associated with climate adaptation, emissions reduction and sustainable development. Some cities are moving forward to transformative adaptation, addressing drivers of vulnerability, building robust systems and anticipating impacts. Besides government-led adaptation planning and action, individuals, communities and enterprises have been incrementally adapting to climate change autonomously over time. Municipalities from Argentina, Peru, Chile, Equator, Brazil and Costa Rica are developing and implementing their Local Climate Action Plans, experimenting with and revealing best practices in adaptation. Both anticipatory adaptation measures—choosing safe locations, building structurally safe houses, choosing elevated places to store valuables, building on stilts—and reactive adaptation measures are used, the latter incorporating measures such as relocation, slope stabilisation, afforestation and greening of riverbanks. With variations, these cities have included mechanisms to work across sectors and actors on the understanding that it is collective planning and actions that will ensure that long-term programmes continue independently of particular city administrations."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#FAQ 12.2_p11,adaptation,"Cities are interconnected systems operating beyond administrative boundaries. Improved collaboration and coordination are needed for integrated responses. Aside from good planning, cities need access to external adaptation funds. Climate-change adaptation requires long-term funding and investments, which are beyond cyclical political considerations. It is crucial to rethink how to ensure that international adaptation funds will reach cities and innovate. For example, member cities of Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy in the region, together with Cities for Life Forum in Peru, the Red Argentina de Municipios por el Cambio Climático (RAMCC), the Capital Cities of the Americas facing Climate Change (CC35) and others, are pursuing this goal and applying directly for international grants. New funding sources are required to help local governments and civil society. Cities and locally driven adaptation initiatives can be funded by national governments and international organisations."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#FAQ 12.4_p6,adaptation;carbon sequestration,"Climate-smart practices provide a framework to operationalise actions aimed at understanding synergies among productivity, adaptation and mitigation. A significant amount of evidence supports the potential for climate-smart-practice technologies to produce such triple wins as natural pastoral systems in the southern region of SA. Such systems allow for the combination of food production and environmental sustainability. The production of meat based on native grasslands with grazing management that optimises forage allowance can achieve high production levels while providing multiple ecosystem benefits. Optimal forage allowance means offering animals enough forage in order to meet requirements while avoiding overgrazing. This management practice simultaneously increases productivity, reduces GHG emissions while improving soil carbon sequestration and minimises other environmental impacts such as excess of nutrients, fossil-based energy use and biodiversity loss. Pastoral farming systems that manage grazing and feeding efficiently are an example of the integration of food security, environmental conservation and nature-based adaptation to climate change."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#FAQ 12.5_p2,adaptation,"There are 28 million Indigenous Peoples in CSA (around 6.6% of the total population of the region). They belong to more than 800 groups living in territories covering a wide range of ecosystems—from drylands to tropical rainforests to savannahs, coasts to mountains—and that share the land with many other cultural and ethnic groups. In the region, Indigenous Peoples are often categorised as groups that are highly vulnerable to climate change because they are frequently affected by socioeconomic inequalities and the dominance of external powers. They often experience internal and external pressures on their communal lands in the forms of pollution, oil and mining, industrial agriculture and urbanisation. On the other hand, it is important to recognise that Indigenous Peoples have knowledge systems and practices that allow them to adapt to many climatic changes. Increasing scientific evidence shows that adaptation initiatives based on Indigenous knowledge and practices are more sustainable and legitimate among local communities."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#FAQ 12.5_p3,adaptation;phenology,"The wide range of adaptation practices based on IK in the region include, among others, increasing species and genetic diversity in agricultural systems through community seed exchanges; promotion of highly diverse crop systems; ancient systems to collect and conserve water; fire prevention strategies; observing and monitoring changes in communal ecological–agricultural calendar cycles; recognising changes in ecological indicators like migration patterns in birds, the behaviour of insects and other invertebrates and the phenology of fruit and flowering species; and systematisation and knowledge exchange among communities. These practices represent a valuable cultural and biological heritage."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#FAQ 12.5_p5,adaptation,"Traditional fire management among Indigenous Peoples of Venezuela, Brazil and Guyana is another adaptation strategy based on a fine-tuned understanding of environmental indicators associated with their culture and worldviews. In these countries, Indigenous lands have the lowest incidence of wildfires, significantly contributing to maintaining and enhancing biodiversity. These traditional practices have helped to prevent large-scale and destructive wildfires, reducing the risks posed by rising temperature and dryness due to climate change."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#FAQ 12.5_p7,adaptation,"Despite the increasing recognition and integration of IK in adaptation practices and policies in the region, important barriers for a more effective and transformative integration remain. Some of the most relevant barriers include limited participation of Indigenous Peoples and local communities in adaptation planning and the lack of sufficient consideration of non-climatic socioeconomic drivers of vulnerability such as poverty and inequality. Also, scientific knowledge is commonly prioritised over traditional IKLK. However, some transformative efforts are emerging. Bolivian Indigenous organisations represent a notable example by contesting normative conceptions of development as economic growth and replacing them with more comprehensive views like harmony with Mother Earth and ‘Sumak Kawsay’ or ‘Good Living’."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#FAQ 12.5_p8,adaptation,"Several strategies have been proposed to overcome existing barriers, including building effective and respectful partnerships among Indigenous and non-Indigenous researchers, co-producing climate-change-relevant knowledge and recognising Indigenous Peoples as active participants in the continual development of autonomous strategies to preserve their practices, beliefs and knowledge. The implementation of these and other strategies can significantly enhance adaptation planning and action in the region."

This holds true even without accounting for benefits in other sustainable development dimensions or non-market damages from climate change (medium confidence). The aggregate global economic repercussions of mitigation pathways include the macroeconomic impacts of investments in low-carbon solutions and structural changes away from emitting activities, co-benefits and adverse side effects of mitigation, (avoided) climate change impacts, and (reduced) adaptation costs. Existing quantifications of global aggregate economic impacts show a strong dependence on socio-economic development conditions, as these shape exposure and vulnerability and adaptation opportunities and responses. (Avoided) impacts for poorer households and poorer countries represent a smaller share in aggregate economic quantifications expressed in GDP or monetary terms, whereas their well-being and welfare effects are comparatively larger.

cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.2.3_p2,adaptation,"One notable development since AR5 is the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs), conceptually outlined in Moss et al. (2010) and subsequently developed to support integrated climate research across the IPCC Working Groups (O’Neill et al. 2014). Initially, a set of SSP narratives were developed, describing worlds with different challenges to mitigation and adaptation (O’Neill et al. 2017a): SSP1 (sustainability), SSP2 (middle of the road), SSP3 (regional rivalry), SSP4 (inequality) and SSP5 (rapid growth). The SSPs have now been quantified in terms of energy, land-use, and emission pathways (Riahi et al. 2017), for both no-climate-policy reference scenarios and mitigation scenarios that follow similar radiative-forcing pathways as the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) assessed in AR5 WGI. Since then the SSPs have been successfully applied in thousands of studies (O’Neill et al. 2020b) including some critiques on the use and application of the SSP framework (Pielke and Ritchie 2021; Rosen 2021). A selection of the quantified SSPs are used prominently in AR6 WGI as they were the basis for most climate modelling since AR5 (O’Neill et al. 2016). Since 2014, when the first set of SSP data was made available, there has been a divergence between scenario and historic trends (Burgess et al. 2020). As a result, the SSPs require updating (O’Neill et al. 2020b). Most of the scenarios in the AR6 database are SSP-based and consider various updates compared to the first release (Riahi et al. 2017)."

If no such complete appraisal in a harmonised framework exists, key elements are emerging from the literature, and assessed in the following subsections: on aggregated economy-wide global mitigation costs (Section 3.6.1), on the economic benefits of avoiding climate impacts (Section 3.6.2), on economic benefits and costs associated with mitigation co-benefits and co-harms (Section 3.6.3) and on the distribution of economic implications between economic sectors and actors (Section 3.6.4)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.6.2_p1,adaptation,"Cost-benefit analyses (CBA) aim to balance all costs and benefits in a unified framework (Nordhaus, 2008). Estimates of economic benefits from avoided climate change impacts depend on the types of damages accounted for, the assumed exposure and vulnerability to these damages as well as the adaptation capacity, which in turn are based on the development pathway assumed (Cross-Working Group Box 1 in this chapter). CBA IAMs raised criticism, in particular for omitting elements of dynamic realism, such as inertia, induced innovation and path dependence, in their representation of mitigation (Grubb et al. 2021), and for underestimating damages from climate change, missing non-monetary damages, the uncertain and heterogeneous nature of damages and the risk of catastrophic damages (Stern 2013, 2016; Diaz and Moore 2017; NASEM 2017; Pindyck 2017; Stoerk et al. 2018; Stern and Stiglitz 2021). Emerging literature has started to address those gaps, and integrated into cost-benefit frameworks the account of heterogeneity of climate damage and inequality (Dennig et al. 2015; Budolfson et al. 2017; Fleurbaey et al. 2019; Kornek et al. 2021), damages with higher persistence, including damages on capital and growth (Moyer et al. 2014; Dietz and Stern 2015; Moore and Diaz 2015; Guivarch and Pottier 2018; Ricke et al. 2018; Piontek et al. 2019), risks of tipping points (Cai et al. 2015, 2016; Lontzek et al. 2015; Lemoine and Traeger 2016; van der Ploeg and de Zeeuw 2018; Cai and Lontzek 2019; Nordhaus 2019; Yumashev et al. 2019; Taconet et al. 2021) and damages to natural capital and non-market goods (Tol 1994; Sterner and Persson 2008; Bastien-Olvera and Moore 2020; Drupp and Hänsel 2021)."

Methodological challenges for economic impact estimates include representing uncertainty and variability, capturing interactions and spillovers, considering distributional effects, representing micro- and macro-adaptation processes, specifying non-gradual damages and non-linearities, and improving understanding of potential long-run growth effects. In addition, the economic benefits aggregated at the global scale provide limited insights into regional heterogeneity. Global economic impact studies with regional estimates find large differences across regions in absolute and percentage terms, with developing and transitional economies typically more vulnerable. Furthermore, (avoided) impacts for poorer households and poorer countries can represent a smaller share in aggregate quantifications expressed in GDP terms or monetary terms, compared to their influence on well-being and welfare (Hallegatte et al. 2020; Markhvida et al. 2020).

In particular, the nexus approach, such as the water and energy nexus and the water-energy-food nexus, is increasingly being used to understand potential emissions and energy savings from cross-sectoral linkages that occur in cities (Wang and Chen 2016; Engström et al. 2017; Valek et al. 2017). There is also a growing literature that aims to quantify transboundary urban GHG emissions and carbon footprint beyond urban and national administrative boundaries (Chen et al. 2016; Hu et al. 2016).

AR5 WGIII Chapter 12 reported a range of co-benefits associated with urban climate change mitigation strategies, including public savings, air quality and associated health benefits, and productivity increases in urban centres (Seto et al. 2014). Since AR5, evidence continues to mount on the co-benefits of urban mitigation. Highlighting co-benefits could make a strong case for driving impactful mitigation action (Bain et al. 2016), especially in developing countries, where development benefits can be the argument for faster implementation (Sethi and Puppim de Oliveira 2018). Through co-benefits, urban areas can couple mitigation, adaptation, and sustainable development while closing infrastructure gaps (Thacker et al. 2019; Kamiya et al. 2020)."

cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.2.3_p1,adaptation,"There are numerous synergies that come from coupling urban adaptation and mitigation. A number of studies have developed methods to assess the synergies between mitigation and adaptation strategies, as well as their co-benefits (Solecki et al. 2015; Buonocore et al. 2016; Chang et al. 2017; Helgenberger and Jänicke 2017). Co-benefits occur when implementing mitigation (or adaptation) measures that have positive effects on adaptation (or mitigation) (Sharifi 2021). In contrast, the trade-offs emerge when measures aimed at improving mitigation (adaptation) undermine the ability to pursue adaptation (mitigation) targets (Sharifi 2020). The magnitude of such co-benefits and trade-offs may vary depending on various factors. A systematic review of over 50 climate change articles provides evidence that mitigation can contribute to resilience – especially to temperature changes and flooding – with varying magnitudes, depending on factors such as the type of mitigation measure and the scale of implementation (Sharifi 2019)."

In addition to their energy-saving and carbon-sequestration benefits, many measures can also enhance adaptation to climate threats, such as extreme heat, energy shocks, floods, and droughts (Sharifi 2021). Existing evidence is mainly related to urban green infrastructure, urban planning, transportation, and buildings. There has been more emphasis on the potential co-benefits of measures, such as proper levels of density, building energy efficiency, distributed and decentralised energy infrastructure, green roofs and facades, and public/active transport modes. Renewable-based distributed and decentralised energy systems improve resilience to energy shocks and can enhance adaptation to water stress considering the water-energy nexus. By further investment on these measures, planners and decision makers can ensure enhancing achievement of mitigation/adaptation co-benefits at the urban level (Sharifi 2021)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.2.3_p3,adaptation;urban heat island,"As for trade-offs, some mitigation efforts may increase exposure to stressors such as flooding and the urban heat island (UHI) effect (see Glossary), thereby reducing the adaptive capacity of citizens. For instance, in some contexts, high-density areas that lack adequate provision of green and open spaces may intensify the UHI effect (Pierer and Creutzig 2019; Xu et al. 2019). There are also concerns that some mitigation efforts may diminish adaptive capacity of urban poor and marginalised groups through increasing costs of urban services and/or eroding livelihood options. Environmental policies designed to meet mitigation targets through phasing out old vehicles may erode livelihood options of poor households, thereby decreasing their adaptive capacity (Colenbrander et al. 2017). Ambitious mitigation and adaptation plans could benefit private corporate interests resulting in adverse effects on the urban poor (Chu et al. 2018; Mehta et al. 2019)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.2.3_p4,adaptation,"Urban green and blue infrastructure such as urban trees, greenspaces, and urban waterways can sequester carbon and reduce energy demand, and provide adaptation co-benefits by mitigating the UHI effect (Berry et al. 2015; Wamsler and Pauleit 2016; WCRP 2019) (Section 8.4.4, Figure 8.18 and Box 8.2)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#cross-working-group-box-2:-cities-and-climate-change_p3,adaptation,"This Cross-Working Group Box on Cities and Climate Change responds to the critical role of urbanisation as a megatrend impacting climate adaptation and mitigation. Issues associated with cities and urbanisation are covered in substantial depth within all three Working Groups (including WGI Box TS.14, WGII Chapter 6 ‘Cities, Settlements and Key Infrastructure’, WGII regional chapters, WGII Cross-Chapter Paper ‘Cities and Settlements by the Sea’, and WGIII Chapter 8 ‘Urban Systems and Other Settlements’). This Box highlights key findings from WGII and III and substantial gaps in literature where more research is urgently needed relating to policy action in cities. It describes methods of addressing mitigation and adaptation in an integrated way across sectors and cities to advance sustainable development and equity outcomes and assesses the governance and finance solutions required to support climate-resilient responses."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#cross-working-group-box-2:-cities-and-climate-change_p6,adaptation,"Urban systems are now global, as evidenced by the interdependencies between infrastructure, services, and networks driven by urban production and consumption; remittance flows and investments reach into rural places, shaping natural resource use far from the city and bring risk to the city when these places are impacted by climate change (WGIII Section 8.4 and Figure 8.15). This megatrend (Kourtit et al. 2015) amplifies as well as shapes the potential impacts of climate events and integrates the aims and approaches for delivering mitigation, adaptation, and sustainable development (medium evidence,  high agreement ) (Dawson et al. 2018; Tsavdaroglou et al. 2018; Zscheischler et al. 2018). For cities facing flood damage, wide-ranging impacts have been recorded on other urban areas near and far (Carter et al. 2021; Simpson et al. 2021) as production and trade is disrupted (Shughrue et al. 2020). In the absence of integrated mitigation and adaptation across and between infrastructure systems and local places, impacts that bring urban economies to a standstill can extend into supply chains and across energy networks causing power outages."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#cross-working-group-box-2:-cities-and-climate-change_p9,adaptation,"Designing for resilient and low-carbon cities today is far easier than retrofitting for risk reduction tomorrow. As urbanisation unfolds, its legacy continues to be the locking-in of emissions and vulnerabilities ( high confidence) (Seto et al. 2016; Ürge-Vorsatz et al. 2018) (see WGIII Section 8.4 and Figure 8.15). Retrofitting, disaster reconstruction, and urban regeneration programmes offer scope for strategic direction changes to low-carbon and high-resilience urban form and function, so long as they are inclusive in design and implementation. Rapid urban growth means new investment, new buildings and infrastructure, new demands for energy and transport and new questions about what a healthy and fulfilling urban life can be. The USD90 trillion expected to be invested in new urban development by 2030 (NCE 2018) is a global opportunity to place adaptation and mitigation directly into urban infrastructure and planning, as well as to consider social policy including education, health care, and environmental management (Ürge-Vorsatz et al. 2018). If this opportunity is missed, and business-as-usual urbanisation persists, social and physical vulnerability will become much more challenging to address."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#cross-working-group-box-2:-cities-and-climate-change_p12,adaptation,"Cities are critical places to realise both adaptation and mitigation actions simultaneously with potential co-benefits that extend far beyond cities (medium evidence,  high agreement ) (Göpfert et al. 2019; Grafakos et al. 2020). Given rapid changes in the built environment, transforming the use of materials and the land intensiveness of urban development, including in many parts of the Global South, will be critical in the next decades, as well as mainstreaming low-carbon development principles in new urban development in all regions. Much of this development will be self-built and ‘informal’ – and new modes of governance and planning will be required to engage with this. Integrating mitigation and adaptation now rather than later, through reshaping patterns of urban development and associated decision-making processes, is a prerequisite for attaining resilient and zero-carbon cities (see WGIII Sections 8.4 and 8.6, and WGIII Figure 8.21)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#cross-working-group-box-2:-cities-and-climate-change_p13,adaptation,"While more cities have developed plans for climate adaptation and mitigation since AR5, many remain to be implemented (limited evidence,  high agreement ) (Araos et al. 2017; Aguiar et al. 2018; Olazabal and Ruiz De Gopegui 2021). A review of local climate mitigation and adaptation plans across 885 urban areas of the European Union suggests mitigation plans are more common than adaptation plans – and that city size, national legislation, and international networks can influence the development of local climate and adaptation plans with an estimated 80% of those cities with above 500,000 inhabitants having a mitigation and/or an adaptation plan (Reckien et al. 2018)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#cross-working-group-box-2:-cities-and-climate-change_p14,adaptation,"Integrated approaches to tackle common drivers of emissions and cascading risks provide the basis for strengthening synergies across mitigation and adaptation, and help manage possible trade-offs with sustainable development (limited evidence, medium agreement ) (Grafakos et al. 2019; Landauer et al. 2019; Pierer and Creutzig 2019). An analysis of 315 local authority emission-reduction plans reveals that the most common policies cover municipal assets and structures (Palermo et al. 2020a). Estimates of emission reductions by non-state and sub-state actors in 10 high-emitting economies projected GHG emissions in 2030 would be 1.2–2.0 GtCO2-eq yr –1 or 3.8–5.5% lower compared to scenario projections for current national policies (31.6–36.8 GtCO2-eq yr –1) if the policies are fully implemented and do not change the pace of action elsewhere (Kuramochi et al. 2020). The value of integrating mitigation and adaptation is underscored in the opportunities for decarbonising existing urban areas, and investing in social, ecological, and technological infrastructure resilience (WGII Section 6.4). Integrating mitigation and adaption is challenging (Landauer et al. 2019) but can provide multiple benefits for the health and well-being of urban inhabitants (Sharifi 2021) (See WGIII Section 8.2.3)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#cross-working-group-box-2:-cities-and-climate-change_p15,adaptation,"Effective climate strategies combine mitigation and adaptation responses, including through linking adaptive urban land use with GHG emission reductions (medium evidence,  high agreement ) (Xu et al. 2019; Patterson 2021). For example, urban green and blue infrastructure can provide co-benefits for mitigation and adaptation (Ürge-Vorsatz et al. 2018) and is an important entry point for integrating adaptation and mitigation at the urban level (Frantzeskaki et al. 2019) (see WGIII Section 8.4.4 and WGIII Figure 8.18). Grey and physical infrastructure, such as sea defences, can immediately reduce risk, but also transfer risk and limit future options. Social policy interventions including social safety nets provide financial security for the most at-risk and can manage vulnerability determined by specific hazards or independently."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#cross-working-group-box-2:-cities-and-climate-change_p18,adaptation,"Key gaps in knowledge include: urban-enabling environments; the role of smaller settlements, low-income communities, and informal settlements, as well as those in rental housing spread across the city; and the ways in which actions to reduce supply chain risk can be supported to accelerate equitable and sustainable adaptation in the face of financial and governance constraints (Birkmann et al. 2016; Shi et al. 2016; Rosenzweig et al. 2018; Dulal 2019)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#cross-working-group-box-2:-cities-and-climate-change_p20,adaptation,"Innovative governance and finance solutions are required to manage complex and interconnected risks across essential key infrastructures, networks, and services, as well as to meet basic human needs in urban areas (medium confidence) (Colenbrander et al. 2018a; Moser et al. 2019). There are many examples of ‘ready-to-use’ policy tools, technologies, and practical interventions for policymakers seeking to act on adaptation and mitigation (Bisaro and Hinkel 2018; Keenan et al. 2019; Chirambo 2021) (see WGIII Section 8.5.4). Tax and fiscal incentives for businesses and individuals can help support city-wide behaviour change towards low-carbon and risk-reducing choices. Change can start where governments have most control – often in public sector institutions and investment – but the challenge ahead requires partnership with private sector and community actors acting at scale and with accountability. Urban climate governance and finance needs to address urban inequalities at the forefront if the urban opportunity is to realise the ambition of the SDGs."

Conditions of complexity, uncertainty, and constrained resources require innovative solutions that are both adaptive and anticipatory. Complex interactions among multiple agents in times of uncertainty makes decision-making about social, economic, governance, and infrastructure choices challenging and can lead decision-makers to postpone action. This is the case for those balancing household budgets, residential investment portfolios, and city-wide policy responsibilities. Living with climate change requires changes to business-as-usual design-making. Co-design and collaboration with communities through iterative policy experimentation can point the way towards climate-resilient development pathways (Ataöv and Peker 2021). Key to successful learning is transparency in policymaking, inclusive policy processes, and robust local modelling, monitoring, and evaluation, which are not yet widely undertaken (Sanchez Rodriguez et al. 2018; Ford et al. 2019)."

While contexts are varied, policy options are often similar enough for the sharing of experiments and policy champions. Sharing expertise can build on existing regional and global networks, many of which have already placed knowledge, learning, and capacity building at the centre of their agendas. Learning from innovative forms of governance and financial investment, as well as strengthening co-production of policy through inclusive access to knowledge and resources, can help address mismatches in local capacities and strengthen wider SDGs and COVID-19 recovery agendas (limited evidence, medium agreement ).

Coupling mitigation and adaptation in an integrated approach offers opportunities to enhance efficiency, increases the coherence of urban climate action, generates cost savings, and provides opportunities to reinvest the savings into new climate action projects to make all urban areas and regions more resilient."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#cross-working-group-box-2:-cities-and-climate-change_p27,adaptation,"Local governments play an important role in driving climate action across mitigation and adaptation as managers of assets, regulators, mobilisers, and catalysts of action, but few cities are undertaking transformative climate adaptation or mitigation actions (limited evidence, medium confidence) (Heikkinen et al. 2019). Local actors are providers of infrastructure and services, regulators of zoning, and can be conveners and champions of an integrated approach for mitigation and adaptation at multiple levels (limited evidence,  high confidence). New opportunities in governance and finance can enable cities to pool resources together and aggregate interventions to innovate ways of mobilising urban climate finance at scale (Colenbrander et al. 2019; Simpson et al. 2019; White and Wahba 2019). However, research increasingly points towards the difficulties faced during the implementation of climate financing in situ, such as the fragmentation of structures of governance capable of managing large investments effectively (Mohammed et al. 2019) (see WGIII Section 8.5 and WGIII Chapter 13)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#cross-working-group-box-2:-cities-and-climate-change_p28,adaptation,"Scaling up transformative place-based action for both adaptation and mitigation requires enabling conditions, including land-based financing, intermediaries, and local partnerships (medium evidence,  high agreement ) (Chu et al. 2019; Chaudhuri, 2020) supported by a new generation of big data approaches. Governance structures that combine actors working at different levels with a different mix of tools are effective in addressing challenges related to implementation of integrated action while cross-sectoral coordination is necessary (Singh et al. 2020). Joint institutionalisation of mitigation and adaptation in local governance structures can also enable integrated action (Göpfert et al. 2020; Hurlimann et al. 2021). However, the proportion of international finance that reaches local recipients remains low, despite the repeated focus of climate policy on place-based adaptation and mitigation (Manuamorn et al. 2020). Green financing instruments that enable local climate action without exacerbating current forms of inequality can jointly address mitigation, adaptation, and sustainable development. Climate finance that also reaches beyond larger non-state enterprises (e.g., small and medium-sized enterprises, local communities, or non-governmental organisations (NGOs)), and is inclusive in responding to the needs of all urban inhabitants (e.g., disabled individuals, or citizens of different races or ethnicities) is essential for inclusive and resilient urban development (Colenbrander et al. 2019; Gabaldón-Estevan et al. 2019; Frenova 2021). Developing networks that can exert climate action at scale is another priority for climate finance."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.4.2.3_p3,adaptation;ecosystem services,"Reducing GHG emissions across different urban growth typologies (Figure 8.20) depends in part on the ability to integrate opportunities for climate mitigation with co-benefits for health and well-being (Grandin et al. 2018). At the same time, requirements for institutional capacity and governance for cross-sector coordination for integrated urban planning is high given the complex relations between urban mobility, buildings, energy systems, water systems, ecosystem services, other urban sectors, and climate adaptation (Große et al. 2016; Castán Broto 2017a; Endo et al. 2017; Geneletti et al. 2017). The capacity for implementing land-use zoning and regulations in a way that is consistent with supporting spatial planning for compact urban form is not equal across urban areas and depends on different contexts as well as institutional capacities (Bakır et al. 2018; Deng et al. 2018; Shen et al. 2019)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.4.4_p1,adaptation;ecosystem services;IUCN,"The findings of AR6 WGI and WGII have underscored the importance of urban green and blue infrastructure for reducing the total warming in urban areas due to its local cooling effect on temperature and its benefits for climate adaptation (IPCC 2021; Cross-Working Group Box 2 in this chapter). Urban green and blue infrastructure in the context of nature-based solutions (NBS) involves the protection, sustainable management, and restoration of natural or modified ecosystems while simultaneously providing benefits for human well-being and biodiversity (IUCN 2021) (see Glossary for additional definitions). As an umbrella concept, urban NBS integrates established ecosystem-based approaches that provide multiple ecosystem services and are important in the context of societal challenges related to urbanisation, climate change, and reducing GHG emissions through the conservation and expansion of carbon sinks (Naumann et al. 2014; Raymond et al. 2017) (Section 8.1.6.1)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.4.4_p2,adaptation,"Urban green and blue infrastructure includes a wide variety of options, from street trees, parks, and sustainable urban drainage systems (Davis and Naumann 2017), to building-related green roofs or green facades, including green walls and vertical forests (Enzi et al. 2017). Figure 8.18 synthesises urban green and blue infrastructure based on urban forests, street trees, green roofs, green walls, blue spaces, greenways, and urban agriculture. Key mitigation benefits, adaptation co-benefits, and SDG linkages are represented by types of green and blue infrastructure. Local implementations of urban green and blue infrastructure can pursue these linkages while progressing toward inclusive sustainable urban planning (SDG 11.3) and the provision of safe, inclusive and accessible green and public spaces for all (SDG 11.7) (Butcher-Gollach 2018; Pathak and Mahadevia 2018; Rigolon et al. 2018; Anguelovski et al. 2019; Buyana et al. 2019; Azunre et al. 2021) (Section 8.2)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.5.4_p5,adaptation,"Indeed, 75% of the global climate finance for both mitigation and adaptation in 2017 and 2018 took the form of commercial financing (e.g., balance sheets, commercial-rate loans, equity), while 25% came in the form of concessionary financing (e.g., grants, below-market-rate loans). However, cities in developing countries are facing difficulty making use of commercial financing and gaining access to international credit markets. Cities without international creditworthiness currently rely on local sources, including domestic commercial banks (medium evidence,  high agreement ) (Global Commission on the Economy and Climate 2014; CCFLA 2015; Floater et al. 2017; Buchner et al. 2019)."

This has cascading effects, including conserving existing green and blue assets (e.g., forests, grasslands, wetlands), many of which sequester and store carbon. Priorities for decarbonising electricity and energy carriers while electrifying mobility, heating, and cooling take place within the integrated approach (Section 8.4.3). Increasing greenways and permeable surfaces, especially from the design of emerging urban areas onward, can be pursued, also for adaptation co-benefits and linkages with the SDGs (Section 8.4.4 and Figure 8.18)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.7.1_p9,adaptation,"Cities could seize this opportunity to provide better infrastructure to further foster active transportation. This could, for example, involve measures, such as expanding cycling networks and restricting existing streets to make them more pedestrian- and cycling-friendly contributing to health and adaptation co-benefits, as discussed in Section 8.2 (Sharifi 2021). Strengthening the science–policy interface is another consideration that could support urban transformation (Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1)."

cleaned_content/syr/longer-report#2.2.2_p4,climate change mitigation,"For almost all basic materials – primary metals, building materials and chemicals – many low- to zero-GHG intensity production processes are at the pilot to near-commercial and in some cases commercial stage but they are not yet established industrial practice. Integrated design in construction and retrofit of buildings has led to increasing examples of zero energy or zero carbon buildings. Technological innovation made possible the widespread adoption of LED lighting. Digital technologies including sensors, the internet of things, robotics, and artificial intelligence can improve energy management in all sectors; they can increase energy efficiency, and promote the adoption of many low-emission technologies, including decentralised renewable energy, while creating economic opportunities. However, some of these climate change mitigation gains can be reduced or counterbalanced by growth in demand for goods and services due to the use of digital devices. Several mitigation options, notably solar energy, wind energy, electrification of urban systems, urban green infrastructure, energy efficiency, demand side management, improved forest- and crop/grassland management, and reduced food waste and loss, are technically viable, are becoming increasingly cost effective and are generally supported by the public, and this enables expanded deployment in many regions.

Almost all mitigation options also face institutional barriers that need to be addressed to enable their application at scale (medium confidence). Current development pathways may create behavioural, spatial, economic and social barriers to accelerated mitigation at all scales (high confidence). Choices made by policymakers, citizens, the private sector and other stakeholders influence societies’ development pathways (high confidence). Structural factors of national circumstances and capabilities (e.g., economic and natural endowments, political systems and cultural factors and gender considerations) affect the breadth and depth of climate governance (medium confidence).

cleaned_content/syr/longer-report#4.8.2_p1,climate change mitigation;Capacity building;Kyoto Protocol;climate justice,"International cooperation is a critical enabler for achieving ambitious climate change mitigation goals and climate resilient development (high confidence). Climate resilient development is enabled by increased international cooperation including mobilising and enhancing access to finance, particularly for developing countries, vulnerable regions, sectors and groups and aligning finance flows for climate action to be consistent with ambition levels and funding needs (high confidence). While agreed processes and goals, such as those in the UNFCCC, Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement, are helping (Section 2.2.1), international financial, technology and capacity building support to developing countries will enable greater implementation and more ambitious actions (medium confidence). By integrating equity and climate justice, national and international policies can help to facilitate shifting development pathways towards sustainability, especially by mobilising and enhancing access to finance for vulnerable regions, sectors and communities (high confidence). International cooperation and coordination, including combined policy packages, may be particularly important for sustainability transitions in emissions-intensive and highly traded basic materials industries that are exposed to international competition. (high confidence). The large majority of emission modelling studies assume significant international cooperation to secure financial flows and address inequality and poverty issues in pathways limiting global warming. There are large variations in the modelled effects of mitigation on GDP across regions, depending notably on economic structure, regional emissions reductions, policy design and level of international cooperation (high confidence). Delayed global cooperation increases policy costs across regions (high confidence). {WGII SPM D.2, WGII SPM D.3.1, WGII SPM D.5.2; WGIII SPM D.3.4, WGIII SPM C5.4, WGIII SPM C.12.2, WGIII SPM E.6, WGIII SPM E.6.1, WGIII E.5.4, WGIII TS.4.2, WGIII TS.6.2; SR1.5 SPM D.6.3, SR1.5 SPM D.7, SR1.5 SPM D.7.3}"
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.2.10_p3,climate change mitigation,"For instance, even if warming achieved by 2100 remained constant after 2100, such committed responses continue to occur. These include: (1) continued Amazon forest loss (Boulton et al., 2017), consistent with results in Pugh et al. (2018) that found continued tropical forest cover loss across a range of models and simulation setups, and (2) across Africa, an increased shift towards woody C3 vegetation was found in equilibrium state, the overall response depending on the atmospheric CO2 concentration (Scheiter et al., 2020). In Pugh et al. (2018), the opposite was found for boreal forest cover, which showed a strong committed increase. The committed changes in vegetation composition correspond to large committed changes in terrestrial carbon uptake and losses (Boulton et al., 2017; Pugh et al., 2018; Scheiter et al., 2020), and would plausibly also appear in other ecosystem functioning and services. These studies point to the importance of having not only a multi-decadal but also a multi-century perspective when exploring the impacts of political decisions on climate change mitigation taken now. Even if climate-warming targets are met, published evidence so far suggests that fundamental changes in some ecosystems are likely  as these correspond to well-understood ecosystem physiological responses that trigger long-term changes in composition."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.7_p4,climate change mitigation,"Large-scale protection and restoration of ecosystems can also make a significant contribution to climate change mitigation (Dinerstein et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2020a; Soto-Navarro et al., 2020). Globally, there is a 38% overlap between areas of high carbon storage and high intact biodiversity (mainly in the peatland tropical forests of Asia, the western Amazon and the high Arctic), but only 12% of this is protected (high confidence) (see also sections 2.4.4.4.1, 2.4.4.4.3, 2.5.3.4) (Soto-Navarro et al., 2020). Peatlands are particularly important carbon stores but are threatened by human disturbance, LULCC (Leifeld et al., 2019) and fire (sections 2.4.3.8, 2.5.2.8) (Turetsky et al., 2015). Restoration of peatlands is not only an efficient climate solution in terms of emissions of GHGs (Nugent et al., 2019), it may also increase ecosystem resilience (Glenk et al., 2021). Global restoration efforts are ongoing to target degraded temperate peatlands in the Americas and Europe (Chimner et al., 2017) in recognition of their importance for climate change mitigation (Paustian et al., 2016; Bossio et al., 2020; Humpenöder et al., 2020; Drever et al., 2021; Tanneberger et al., 2021). It has been estimated that the global GHG-saving potential of peatland restoration is similar to the most optimistic sequestration potential from all agricultural soils (Leifeld and Menichetti, 2018). However, the pressure on peatlands from human activity remains high in many parts of the world (Humpenöder et al., 2020; Tanneberger et al., 2021). Currently, the rapid destruction of tropical peatlands overshadows any current restoration efforts in temperate peatlands or any potential carbon gain from natural high-latitude peatlands (Roucoux et al., 2017; Wijedasa et al., 2017; Leifeld et al., 2019) (Sections 2.4.3.8, 2.4.4.4.2, 2.4.4.4.4, 2.5.2.8, 2.5.3.4)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#box-2.2_p2,climate change mitigation,"BECCS is an integral part of all widely accepted pathways to keeping global temperature rise to 1.5°C (IPCC, 2018b). This requires large areas of land, which can be in conflict with the need to produce food and protect biodiversity (Smith et al., 2018). One study examined the combined impacts of climate change and LULCC for bioenergy, and found that severe impacts on species were likely if bioenergy was a major component of strategies for climate change mitigation (Hof et al., 2018). A study on the potential impacts of bioenergy production and climate change on European birds found that one scenario for land conversion for bioenergy to meet a 2°C target would have less impact on species range loss than a global temperature increase of 4°C, but noted that if bioenergy were the only mitigation option it would 'very likely result in the negative effects of bioenergy outweighing the positive effects' (Meller et al., 2015). To avoid the worst impacts of BECCS, it will need to be carefully targeted according to context and local conditions, and other mitigation strategies prioritised so that its use can be minimised (IPCC, 2019a; Ohashi et al., 2019)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#executive-summary_p27,climate change mitigation,"Many of the potential trade-offs of mitigation measures for other sustainable development outcomes depend on policy design and can thus be compensated or avoided with additional policies and investments or through policies that integrate mitigation with other SDGs (high confidence). Targeted SDG policies and investments, for example in the areas of healthy nutrition, sustainable consumption and production, and international collaboration, can support climate change mitigation policies and resolve or alleviate trade-offs . Trade-offs can be addressed by complementary policies and investments, as well as through the design of cross-sectoral policies integrating mitigation with the Sustainable Development Goals of health, nutrition, sustainable consumption and production, equity and biodiversity. {3.7}"
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#box-3.5_p1,climate change mitigation;feedback,"Most studies that have developed mitigation pathways have used a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) framework, which aim to compare the costs of different mitigation strategies designed to meet a given climate change mitigation goal (e.g., an emission-reduction target or a temperature stabilisation target) but does not represent economic impacts from climate change itself, nor the associated economic benefits of avoided impacts. Other studies use modelling frameworks that represent the feedback of damages from climate change on the economy in a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) approach, which balances mitigation costs and benefits. This second type of study is represented in Section 3.6.2."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.6.3_p2,climate change mitigation,"Systematic reviews of the literature on co-benefits and trade-offs from mitigation actions have shown that only a small portion of articles provide economic quantifications (Deng et al. 2017; Karlsson et al. 2020). Most economic quantifications use monetary valuation approaches. Improved air quality, and associated health effects, are the co-benefit category dominating the literature (Markandya et al. 2018; Vandyck et al. 2018; Scovronick et al. 2019; Howard et al. 2020; Karlsson et al. 2020 b; Rauner et al. 2020a,b), but some studies cover other categories, including health effects from diet change (Springmann et al. 2016b) and biodiversity impacts (Rauner et al. 2020a). Regarding health effects from air quality improvement and from diet change, co-benefits are shown to be of the same order of magnitude as mitigation costs (Thompson et al. 2014; Springmann et al. 2016a,b; Markandya et al. 2018; Scovronick et al. 2019b; Howard et al. 2020; Rauner et al. 2020a,b; Liu et al. 2021; Yang et al. 2021). Co-benefits from improved air quality are concentrated sooner in time than economic benefits from avoided climate change impacts (Karlsson et al. 2020), such that when accounting both for positive health impacts from reduced air pollution and for the negative climate effect of reduced cooling aerosols, optimal GHG mitigation pathways exhibit immediate and continual net economic benefits (Scovronick et al. 2019a). However, AR6 WGI Chapter 6 (Section 6.7.3) shows a delay in air pollution reduction benefits when they come from climate change mitigation policies compared with air pollution reduction policies."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.6.4.2_p1,climate change mitigation,"Mitigation policies can have important distributive effects between and within countries, either reducing or increasing economic inequality and poverty, depending on policy instruments’ design and implementation (see Section 3.6.1.2 for an assessment of the distribution of mitigation costs across regions in mitigation pathways; Sections 3.7 and 4.2.2.6, and Box 3.6 for an assessment of the fairness and ambition of NDCs; and Section 4.5 for an assessment of national mitigation pathways along the criteria of equity, including Just Transition, as well as Section 17.4.5 for equity in a Just Transition). For instance, emissions taxation has important distributive effects, both between and within income groups (Cronin et al. 2018b; Klenert et al. 2018; Pizer and Sexton 2019; Douenne 2020; Steckel et al. 2021). These effects are more significant in some sectors, such as transport, and depend on country-specific consumption structures (Dorband et al. 2019; Fullerton and Muehlegger 2019; Ohlendorf et al. 2021). However, revenues from emissions taxation can be used to lessen their regressive distributional impacts or even turn the policy into a progressive policy reducing inequality and/or leading to gains for lower-income households (Cameron et al. 2016; Jakob and Steckel 2016; Fremstad and Paul 2019; Fujimori et al. 2020b; Böhringer et al. 2021; Budolfson et al. 2021; Soergel et al. 2021b; Steckel et al. 2021). Mitigation policies may affect the poorest through effects on energy and food prices (Hasegawa et al. 2015; Fujimori et al. 2019). Markkanen and Anger-Kraavi (2019) and Lamb et al. (2020) synthesize evidence from the existing literature on social co-impacts of climate change mitigation policy and their implications for inequality. They show that most policies can compound or lessen inequalities depending on contextual factors, policy design and policy implementation, but that negative inequality impacts of climate policies can be mitigated (and possibly even prevented), when distributive and procedural justice are taken into consideration in all stages of policymaking, including policy planning, development and implementation, and when focusing on the carbon intensity of lifestyles, sufficiency and equity, well-being and decent living standards for all (Section 13.6)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.7.2.2_p1,climate change mitigation,"Recent studies explore the effect of climate change mitigation on agricultural markets and food security (Havlík et al. 2014; Hasegawa et al. 2018; Doelman et al. 2019; Fujimori et al. 2019). Mitigation policies aimed at achieving 1.5°C–2°C, if not managed properly, could negatively affect food security through changes in land and food prices ( high confidence), leading to increases in the population at risk of hunger by 80–280 million people compared to baseline scenarios. These studies assume uniform carbon prices on AFOLU sectors (with some sectoral caps) and do not account for climate impacts on food production."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.7.5.2_p3,climate change mitigation,"The avoided health impacts associated with climate change mitigation can substantially offset mitigation costs at the societal level (Ščasný et al. 2015; Schucht et al. 2015; Chang et al. 2017; Markandya et al. 2018). Models of health co-benefits show that a 1.5°C pathway could result in 152 million ± 43 million fewer premature deaths worldwide between 2020 and 2100 in comparison to a business-as-usual scenario, particularly due to reductions in exposure to PM2.5 (Shindell et al. 2018; Rauner et al. 2020a; Rafaj et al. 2021). Some of the most substantial health, well-being, and equity benefits associated with climate action derive from investing in basic infrastructure: sanitation, clean drinking water, clean energy, affordable healthy diets, clean public transport, and improved air quality from transformative solutions across economic sectors including agriculture, energy, transport and buildings (Chang et al. 2017)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.7.6.2_p2,climate change mitigation,"Climate change mitigation actions to reduce or slow negative impacts on ecosystems are likely  to support the achievement of SDGs 2, 3, 6, 12, 14 and 15. Some studies show that stringent and constant GHG mitigation practices bring a net benefit to global biodiversity even if land-based mitigation measures are also adopted (Ohashi et al. 2019), as opposed to delayed action which would require much more widespread use of BECCS. Scenarios based on demand reductions of energy and land-based production are expected to avoid many such consequences, due to their minimised reliance on BECCS (Conijn et al. 2018; Grubler et al. 2018; Bowles et al. 2019; Soergel et al. 2021a). Stringent mitigation that includes reductions in demand for animal-based foods and food waste could also relieve pressures on land use and biodiversity ( high confidence), both directly by reducing agricultural land requirements (Leclère et al. 2020) and indirectly by reducing the need for land-based CDR (van Vuuren et al. 2018)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.1.1.2_p1,climate change mitigation,"One major innovation in this Assessment Report is the inclusion of historical and future urban GHG emissions. Urban emissions based on consumption-based accounting by regions has been put forth for the time frame 1990–2100 using multiple datasets with projections given in the framework of the Shared Socio-economic Pathway (SSP)–Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. This advance has provided a time dimension to urban footprints considering different climate scenarios with implications for urban mitigation, allowing a comparison of the way urban emissions and their reduction can evolve given different scenario contexts (see Glossary for definitions of various ‘pathways’ and ‘scenarios’ in the context of climate change mitigation, including ‘SSPs’ and ‘RCPs’)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.1.4_p1,climate change mitigation,"The 21st century will be the urban century, defined by a massive increase in global urban populations and a significant building up of new urban infrastructure stock to accommodate the growing urban population. Six trends in urbanisation are especially important in the context of climate change mitigation. 4 "
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.1.4_p3,climate change mitigation,"Second, the geographic concentration of the world’s current urban population is in emerging economies, and the majority of future urban population growth will take place in developing countries and least-developed countries (LDCs). About half of the world’s urban population in 2018 lived in just seven countries, and about half of the increase in urban population through 2050 is projected to be concentrated in eight countries (UN DESA 2019) (Figure 8.2). Of these eight, seven are emerging economies where there will be a need for significant financing to construct housing, roads, and other urban infrastructure to accommodate the growth of the urban population. How these new cities of tomorrow will be designed and constructed will lock-in patterns of urban energy behaviour for decades if not generations (Sections 8.3.4 and 8.4). Thus, it is essential that urban climate change mitigation strategies include solutions appropriate for cities of varying sizes and typologies (Section 8.6 and Figure 8.21)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.1.4_p9,climate change mitigation,"Sixth, urbanisation in many emerging economies is characterised by informality and an informal economy (Brown and McGranahan 2016). The urban informal economy includes a wide array of activities, including but not limited to street vending, home-based enterprises, unreported income from self-employment, informal commerce, domestic service, waste-picking, and urban agriculture. The urban informal economy is large and growing. Globally, about 44% of the urban economy is informal, although there is much variation between countries and regions (ILO 2018). Emerging and developing economies have the highest percentage of the urban informal economy, with Africa (76%) and the Arab States (64%) with the largest proportion (ILO 2018). Urban informality also extends to planning, governance and institutions (Roy 2009; EU 2016; Lamson-Hall et al. 2019). Given its prevalence, it is important for urban climate change mitigation strategies to account for informality, especially in emerging and developing countries (Section 8.3.2)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.1.5_p1,climate change mitigation,"Urbanisation in the 21st century will be dominated by population and infrastructure growth in developing countries, and as such it is important to highlight three aspects that are unique and especially relevant for climate change mitigation. First, urbanisation will increase in speed and magnitude. Given their significant impact on emissions, mitigation action in Asian cities, especially the large and rapidly growing cities, will have significant implications on global ambitions (Section 8.3.4)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.2.1_p5,climate change mitigation,"Evidence on the co-benefits of urban mitigation measures for human health has increased significantly since AR5, especially through the use of health impact assessments, where energy savings and cleaner energy supply structures based on measures for urban planning, heating, and transport have reduced CO2, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and coarse particulate matter (PM10) emissions (Diallo et al. 2016). Some measures, especially those related to land-use planning and transportation, have also increased opportunities for physical activity for improved health (Diallo et al. 2016). In developing countries, the co-benefits approach has been effective in justifying climate change mitigation actions at the local level (Puppim de Oliveira and Doll 2016). Mixed-use compact development with sufficient land-use diversity can have a positive influence on urban productivity (Section 8.4.2). Conversely, urban spatial structures that increase walking distances and produce car dependency have negative impacts on urban productivity considering congestion as well as energy costs (Salat et al. 2017)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.3_p1,climate change mitigation,"This section assesses trends in urban land use, the built environment, and urban GHG emissions, as well as forecasts for urban land use and emissions under certain scenarios to 2050 or 2100. These trends and scenarios hold implications for optimising the approaches to urban climate change mitigation discussed in Sections 8.4 and 8.6."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.3.4_p1,climate change mitigation,"This section assesses scenarios of future urban land expansion and urban GHG emissions. These scenarios have implications for the urban climate change mitigation strategies discussed in Sections 8.4 and 8.6 – in particular, in the context of the potential mitigation and development pathways for urban areas under certain scenarios."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.4.3.1_p1,climate change mitigation,"Urban energy infrastructures often operate as part of larger energy systems that can be electrified, decarbonised, and become enablers of urban system flexibility through demand-side options. With multiple end-use sectors (e.g., transport, buildings) and their interactions with land use drawing on the same urban energy system(s), increasing electrification is essential for rapid decarbonisation, renewable energy penetration, and demand flexibility (Kammen and Sunter 2016) (see IMPs in Sections 3.2.5 and 8.3.4). The mitigation potential of electrification is ultimately dependent on the carbon intensity of the electricity grid (Kennedy 2015; Hofmann et al. 2016; Peng et al. 2018; Zhang and Fujimori 2020) and starts providing lifecycle emission savings for carbon intensities below a threshold of 600 tCO2-eq GWh –1 (Kennedy et al. 2019). Integrated systems of roof-top photovoltaics (PVs) and all-electric vehicles (EVs) alone could supply affordable carbon-free electricity to cities and reduce CO2 emissions by 54–95% (Brenna et al. 2014; Kobashi et al. 2021). Furthermore, electrification and decarbonisation of the urban energy system holds widespread importance for climate change mitigation across different urban growth typologies and urban form (Section 8.6 and Figure 8.21) and leads to a multitude of public health co-benefits (see Section 8.2)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.5_p1,climate change mitigation,"Governance and other institutions act as core components to urban systems by facilitating and managing linkages between different sectors, geographic regions, and stakeholders. This position renders subnational governments and institutions key enablers of climate change mitigation (Seto et al. 2016, 2021; Hsu et al. 2018, 2020c; Vedeld et al. 2021) (Section 8.4.1). Indeed, since AR5 more research has emerged identifying these actors as vehicles through which to accelerate local-to-global efforts to decarbonise (IPCC 2018a; Hsu et al. 2020b; Salvia et al. 2021; Seto et al. 2021) (Chapter 13, Sections 4.2.3, 14.5.5, 15.6.5 and 16.4.7, and ‘subnational actors’ in Glossary). The current extent (Section 8.3.3) and projected rise (Section 8.3.4.2) in the urban share of global emissions underscores the transformative global impact of supporting urban climate governance and institutions (Section 8.5.2). Further, the multisector approach to mitigation emphasised in this chapter (Sections 8.4 and 8.6, and Figure 8.21) highlights the need for facilitation across sectors (Figure 8.19)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.5.1.1_p3,climate change mitigation,"Still, there are constraints on urban autonomy that might limit urban mitigation influence. The capacity of subnational governments to autonomously pursue emissions reductions on their own depends on different political systems and other aspects of multi-level governance, such as innovation, legitimacy, and institutional fit, as well as the resources, capacity, and knowledge available to subnational technicians and other officials (Widerberg and Pattberg 2015; Valente de Macedo et al. 2016; Green 2017; Roger et al. 2017). Financing is considered one of the most crucial facets of urban climate change mitigation. It is also considered one of the biggest barriers, given the limited financial capacities of local and regional governments (Sections 8.5.4 and 8.5.5)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.5.1.1_p4,climate change mitigation,"When sufficient local autonomy is present, local policies have the ability to upscale to higher levels of authority, imparting influence at higher geographic scales. Established urban climate leaders with large institutional capacity can influence small and mid-sized cities, or other urban areas with less institutional capacity, to enact effective climate policies, by engaging with those cities through transnational networks and by adopting a public presence of climate leadership (Chan et al. 2015; Kern 2019; Seto et al. 2021) (Section 8.5.3). Increasingly, subnational actors are also influencing their national and international governments through lobbying efforts that call on them to adopt more ambitious climate goals and provide more support for subnational GHG mitigation efforts (Linton et al. 2021; Seto et al. 2021). These dynamics underscore the importance of relative local autonomy in urban GHG mitigation policy. They also highlight the growing recognition of subnational authorities’ role in climate change mitigation by national and international authorities."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#FAQ 8.1 | 	Why are urban areas important to global climate change mitigation?_p1,climate change mitigation,"Over half of the world’s population currently resides in urban areas – a number forecasted to increase to nearly 70% by 2050. Urban areas also account for a growing proportion of national and global emissions, depending on emissions scope and geographic boundary. These trends are projected to grow in the coming decades; in 2100, some scenarios show the urban share of global emissions above 80%, with 63% being the minimum for any scenario (with the shares being in different contexts of emissions reduction or increase) (Sections 8.3.3 and 8.3.4). As such, urban climate change mitigation considers the majority of the world’s population, as well as some of the key drivers of global emissions. In general, emissions scenarios with limited outward urban land expansion are also associated with a smaller rise in global temperature (Section 8.3.4)."

There are limitations in all models and it is critical that modellers understand the assumptions, proper parameterization and limitations of each model technique, including differences between climate models, emission scenarios or RCPs and baselines (Araujo et al., 2019). Several systems automate the development of SDMs, including R-packages (Beaumont et al., 2016; Hallgren et al., 2016), and other model types (Foden et al., 2019) and aid in the use of climate model data (Suggitt et al., 2017), including allowing for connectivity constraints (Peterson et al., 2013).

cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.2.1.2_p1,climate model,"Mitigation scenarios explore different strategies to meet climate goals and are typically derived from reference scenarios by adding climate or other policies. Mitigation pathways are often developed to meet a predefined level of climate change, often referred to as a backcast. There are relatively few IAMs that include an endogenous climate model or emulator due to the added computational complexity, though exceptions do exist. In practice, models implement climate constraints by either iterating carbon-price assumptions (Strefler et al. 2021b) or by adopting an associated carbon budget (Riahi et al. 2021). In both cases, other GHGs are typically controlled by CO2-equivalent pricing. A large part of the AR5 literature has focused on forcing pathways towards a target at the end of the century (van Vuuren et al. 2007, 2011; Clarke et al. 2009; Blanford et al. 2014; Riahi et al. 2017), featuring a temporary overshoot of the warming and forcing levels (Geden and Löschel 2017). In comparison, many recent studies explore mitigation strategies that limit overshoot (Johansson et al. 2020; Riahi et al. 2021). An increasing number of IAM studies also explore climate pathways that limit adverse side effects with respect to other societal objectives, such as food security (van Vuuren et al. 2019; Riahi et al. 2021) or larger sets of sustainability objectives (Soergel et al. 2021a)."

The magnitude, the rate, the timing of threshold exceedances, and the long-term commitment of sea level rise depend on emissions, with higher emissions leading to greater and faster rates of sea level rise.

Simulating changes in tundra vegetation is complicated by permafrost dynamics (e.g., the formation of thaw ponds and draining of existing ponds), changes in precipitation and low nutrient availability (which may promote the abundance of graminoids) (van der Kolk et al., 2016). Changes in vegetation, when combined with warming and increased precipitation effects on soil thawing and carbon cycling, are projected to modify GHG emissions and have biophysical feedbacks to regional and global climate. High uncertainty in modelled carbon cycle changes arises from differences between the vegetation models (Nishina et al., 2015; Ito et al., 2016). In addition, climate change is expected to strongly interact with other factors, such as fire, to further increase uncertainty in projections of tundra ecosystem function (Jiang et al., 2017)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.3.4_p1,carbon cycle;carbon sink,"Globally, increasing atmospheric CO2 enhances the terrestrial sink but temperature increases constrain it, reflecting the biological process understanding highlighted in previous IPCC reports (high confidence). Analyses of atmospheric inversion model output and spatial climate data indicate a sensitivity of net ecosystem productivity to CO2 fertilisation of 3.1 ± 0.1 Gt to 8.1 ± 0.3 Gt per 100 ppm CO2 (~1°C increase) and a sensitivity to temperature of -0.5 ± 0.2 Gt to -1.1 ± 0.1 Gt per degree Celsius (Fernandez-Martinez et al., 2019). The future of the global land carbon sink (Section 2.4.4.4) nevertheless remains highly uncertain because (i) of regionally complex interactions of climate change and changes in atmospheric CO2 with vegetation, soil and aquatic processes, (ii) episodic events such as heat waves or droughts (and related impacts through mortality, wildfire or insects, pests and diseases) (Section 2.5.3.2, 2.5.3.3) are so far only incompletely captured in carbon cycle models, (iii) the legacy effects from historic LUC and environmental changes are incompletely captured but likely to decline in future and (iv) lateral carbon transport processes such as the export of inland waters and erosion are incompletely understood and modelled (Pugh et al., 2019a; Friedlingstein et al., 2020; Krause et al., 2020; Canadell et al., 2021)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.3.5_p3,carbon cycle;feedback,"Feedbacks can be positive or negative (i.e., amplify or dampen the original forcing), vary spatially and seasonally, and act over large geographic areas and long time periods (more than decades), making them difficult to observe and quantify directly (Schimel et al., 2015; Canadell et al., 2021). Due to the positive impacts of CO2 on vegetation growth and ecosystem carbon storage (high confidenc e) (Sections 2.4.4.4, 2.5.5.4) (Canadell et al., 2021), the associated climate feedback is negative (i.e., increased removal of atmospheric CO2 and dampened warming, compared to an absence of the feedback). By contrast, projected global losses of carbon in warmer climates (Canadell et al., 2021) imply a positive climate feedback. WGI (Canadell et al., 2021) assesses an overall increase in land carbon uptake through the 21st century. However, the overall strength of the carbon cycle–climate feedback remains very uncertain. One of the underlying reasons may be complex interactions with ecosystem water balance and nitrogen and phosphorous availability, which are poorly constrained by observational evidence and incompletely captured in ESMs (Section 2.5.2.10) (Huntzinger et al., 2017; Canadell et al., 2021)."

Additional surface–atmosphere feedbacks that arise from changes in vegetation cover and subsequently altered albedo, evapotranspiration or roughness (often summarised as biophysical feedbacks) can be regionally relevant and could amplify or dampen vegetation cover changes (Jia et al., 2019)."

Browning negatively affects the taste of drinking water and this may be difficult to address (Kothawala et al., 2015; Kritzberg et al., 2020). It also often reduces attractiveness for recreational purposes, especially swimming (Arthington and Hadwen, 2003; Keeler et al., 2015). Based on a worst-case climate scenario until 2030, (Weyhenmeyer et al., 2016) projected an increase in the browning of lakes and rivers in boreal Sweden by a factor of 1.3. The chemical character of DOM, as modified by climate change (Kellerman et al., 2014), determines its amenability to removal by water treatment (Ritson et al., 2014). Therefore, in order to provide safe and acceptable drinking water, more advanced, more expensive and more energy/resource-intensive technical solutions may be required (Matilainen et al., 2010)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.3.2.1_p4,carbon cycle;climate sensitivity,"Figure 3.11 shows the possible consequences of the different scenario categories for global mean temperature calculated using a reduced complexity model (RCM) calibrated to the IPCC AR6 WGI assessment (see Annex III.II.2.5 of this report and Cross-Chapter Box 7.1 in AR6 WGI report). For the C5–C7 categories (containing most of the reference and current policy scenarios), the global mean temperature is expected to increase throughout the century (and further increase will happen after 2100 for C6 and C7). While warming would more likely than not  be in the range from 2.2°C to 3.5°C, warming up to 5°C cannot be excluded. The highest emissions scenarios in the literature combine assumptions about rapid long-term economic growth and pervasive climate policy failures, leading to a reversal of some recent trends (Box 3.3). For the categories C1–C4, a peak in global mean temperature is reached mid-century for most scenarios in the database, followed by a small (C3/C4) or more considerable decline (C1/C2). There is a clear distinction between the scenarios with no or limited overshoot (typically <0.1°C, C1) compared to those with high overshoot (C2): in emissions, the C1 category is characterised by steep early reductions and a relatively small contribution of net negative emissions (like IMP-LD and IMP-Ren) (Figure 3.10). In addition to the temperature caused by the range of scenarios in each category (main panel), climate uncertainties also contribute to a range of temperature outcomes (including uncertainties regarding the carbon cycle, climate sensitivity, and the rate of change, see AR6 WGI). The bars on the right of Figure 3.11 show the uncertainty range for each category (combining scenario and climate uncertainty). While the C1 category more likely than not  limits warming to 1.5°C (>50%) by the end of the century, even with such a scenario, warming above 2°C cannot be excluded (95th percentile). The uncertainty range for the highest emission categories (C7) implies that these scenarios could lead to a warming above 6°C."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.6.2_p2,carbon cycle,"Each of these factors, when accounted for in a CBA framework, tends to increase the welfare benefit of mitigation, thus leading to stabilisation at a lower temperature in optimal mitigation pathways. The limitations in CBA modelling frameworks remain significant, their ability to represent all damages incomplete, and the uncertainty in estimates remains large. However, emerging evidence suggests that, even without accounting for co-benefits of mitigation on other sustainable development dimensions (see Section 3.6.3 for further details about on co-benefits), global benefits of pathways that limit warming to 2°C outweigh global mitigation costs over the 21st century: depending on the study, the reason for this result lies in assumptions of economic damages from climate change in the higher end of available estimates (Moore and Diaz 2015; Ueckerdt et al. 2019; Brown and Saunders 2020; Glanemann et al. 2020), in the introduction of risks of tipping points (Cai and Lontzek 2019), in the consideration of damages to natural capital and non-market goods (Bastien-Olvera and Moore 2020) or in the combination of updated representations of carbon cycle and climate modules, updated damage estimates and/or updated representations of economic and mitigation dynamics (Dietz and Stern 2015; Hänsel et al. 2020; Wei et al. 2020; van der Wijst et al. 2021b). In the studies cited above that perform a sensitivity analysis, this result is found to be robust to a wide range of assumptions on social preferences (in particular, on inequality aversion and pure rate-of-time preference) and holds except if assumptions of economic damages from climate change are in the lower end of available estimates and the pure rate-of-time preference is in the higher range of values usually considered (typically above 1.5%). However, although such pathways bring net benefits over time (in terms of aggregate discounted present value), they involve distributional consequences and transition costs (Brown et al. 2020; Brown and Saunders 2020) (Sections 3.6.1.2 and 3.6.4)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.4.3.2_p2,carbon cycle;Deforestation;carbon sequestration;carbon sink,"The initial carbon debt incurred in the production stage, even in sustainable buildings, can take decades to offset through operational stage energy efficiencies alone. Increased reduction in the energy demands and GHG emissions associated with the manufacture of mineral-based construction materials will be challenging, as these industries have already optimised their production processes. Among the category of primary structural materials, it is estimated that final energy demand for steel production can be reduced by nearly 30% compared to 2010 levels, with 12% efficiency improvement for cement (Lechtenböhmer et al. 2016). Even when industries are decarbonised, residual CO2 emissions will remain from associated chemical reactions that take place in calcination and use of coke from coking coal to reduce iron oxide (Davis et al. 2018). Additionally, carbon sequestration by cement occurs over the course of the building lifecycle in quantities that would offset only a fraction of their production stage carbon spike (Xi et al. 2016; Davis et al. 2018). Moreover, there are collateral effects on the carbon cycle related to modern construction and associated resource extraction. The production of cement, asphalt, and glass requires large amounts of sand extracted from beaches, rivers, and seafloors, disturbing aquatic ecosystems and reducing their capacity to absorb atmospheric carbon. The mining of ore can lead to extensive local deforestation and soil degradation (Sonter et al. 2017). Deforestation significantly weakens the converted land as a carbon sink and in severe cases may even create a net emissions source."

For the first time in an IPCC assessment cycle, multi-model projections of global surface temperature, ocean warming and sea level are constrained using observations and the assessed climate sensitivity. The likely  range of equilibrium climate sensitivity has been narrowed to 2.5°C to 4.0°C (with a best estimate of 3.0°C) based on multiple lines of evidence 112 , including improved understanding of cloud feedbacks.

cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#box-3.3_p1,climate sensitivity,"At the time the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) were published, they included three scenarios that could represent emission developments in the absence of climate policy: RCP4.5, RCP6 and RCP8.5, described as, respectively, low, medium and high-end scenarios in the absence of strong climate policy (van Vuuren et al. 2011). RCP8.5 was described as representative of the top 5% scenarios in the literature. The SSPs-based set of scenarios covered the RCP forcing levels, adding a new low scenario (at 1.9 W m –2). Hausfather and Peters (2020) pointed out that since 2011, the rapid development of renewable energy technologies and emerging climate policy have made it considerably less likely that emissions could end up as high as RCP8.5. Still, emission trends in developing countries track RCP8.5 Pedersen et al. (2020), and high land-use emissions could imply that emissions would continue to do so in the future, even at the global scale (Schwalm et al. 2020). Other factors resulting in high emissions include higher population or economic growth as included in the SSPs (Section 3.3.1) or rapid development of new energy services. Climate projections of RCP8.5 can also result from strong feedbacks of climate change on (natural) emission sources and high climate sensitivity (AR6 WGI Chapter 7), and therefore their median climate impacts might also materialise while following a lower emission path (e.g., Hausfather and Betts 2020). The discussion also relates to a more fundamental discussion on assigning likelihoods to scenarios, which is extremely difficult given the deep uncertainty and direct relationship with human choice. However, it would help to appreciate certain projections (e.g., Ho et al. 2019). All in all, this means that high-end scenarios have become considerably less likely since AR5 but cannot be ruled out. It is important to realise that RCP8.5 and SSP5-8.5 do not represent a typical ‘business-as-usual’ projection but are only useful as high-end, high-risk scenarios. Reference emission scenarios (without additional climate policy) typically end up in the C5–C7 categories included in this assessment."

The magnitude of woody cover change in savannas is not correlated with mean annual temperature change (Criado et al., 2020); however, higher atmospheric CO2 increases shrub growth in savannas (Nackley et al., 2018; Manea and Leishman, 2019). A global remote-sensing analysis of biome changes from all causes, including agricultural and grazing expansion and deforestation, estimated that 14% of pixels changed between 1981 and 2012, although this approach can overestimate global changes, since it uses a new biome classification system which doubles the conventional biome classifications (Higgins et al., 2016).

Across the temperate and tropical biomes, extensive drainage and deforestation have caused widespread water table draw-downs and/or peat subsidence, as well as high CO2 emissions (medium evidence, high agreement ). Climate change is compounding these impacts (medium evidence, medium agreement ). For example, in Indonesia, the highest emissions from drained tropical peatlands were reported in the extremely dry year of the 1997 El Niño (810–2570 TgC yr -1) (Page et al., 2002) and the 2015 fire season (380 TgC yr -1) (Field et al., 2016).

Roads facilitate deforestation, fragmenting the rainforest and increasing the dryness and flammability of vegetation (Alencar et al., 2015). Extreme droughts that occur during warm phases of the ENSO and the Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation combine with the degradation of vegetation to cause extreme fire events (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Fonseca et al., 2017; Aragao et al., 2018; da Silva et al., 2018 ; Burton et al., 2020; dos Reis et al., 2021; Libonati et al., 2021). In the State of Roraima, Brazil, distance to roads and infrastructure that enable deforestation and ENSO were the factors most explaining fire occurrence in the extreme 2015–2016 fire season (Fonseca et al., 2017). From 1973 to 2014, burned area increased in the Amazon, coinciding with increased deforestation (van Marle et al., 2017). In the State of Acre, Brazil, burned area increased 36-fold from 1984 to 2016, with 43% burned in agricultural and livestock settlement areas (da Silva et al., 2018 ). In the extreme fire year 2019, 85% of the area burned in the Amazon occurred in areas deforested in 2018 (Cardil et al., 2020). Even though relatively higher moisture in 2019 led to burning below the 2002–2019 average across most of South America, burning in areas of recent deforestation in the Amazon were above the 2002–2019 average, indicating that deforestation, not meteorological conditions, triggered the 2019 fires (Kelley et al., 2021; Libonati et al., 2021). Furthermore, from 1981 to 2018, deforestation in the Amazon reduced moisture inputs to the lower atmosphere, increasing drought and fire in a self-reinforcing feedback (Xu et al., 2020). In the Amazon, deforestation exerts an influence on wildfire that can be stronger than climate change (robust evidence, high agreement )."

In addition, in a set of 310 Amazon field plots, an annual average temperature increase of 1.2°C from 1950 to 2018 (Marengo et al., 2018) contributed to tree mortality of ~40% from 1983 to 2011 (Brienen et al., 2015). In another set of plots, mortality among newly recruited trees of mesic genera increased and drought-tolerant genera became more abundant from 1985 to 2015 (Esquivel-Muelbert et al., 2019). In other plots, tree mortality did not show a statistically significant change from 1965 to 2016, but rose abruptly in severe drought years, mainly during warm phases of the ENSO (Aleixo et al., 2019). Nearly half the area of the Amazon has experienced extremely dry conditions during ENSO warm phases; this can cause extensive wildfire (Section 2.4.4.2.3). Wildfires can increase tree mortality rates by >600% above rates in non-burned areas, with the higher mortality persisting for up to a decade after a fire (Silva et al., 2018; Berenguer et al., 2021). Climate change has contributed to tree mortality in the Amazon rainforest (medium evidence, medium agreement )."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.4.4.1_p3,Deforestation,"Tropical deforestation and the draining and burning of peatlands produce almost all of the carbon emissions from LUC (Houghton and Nassikas, 2017; Friedlingstein et al., 2020), while forest growth accounts for two-thirds of ecosystem carbon removals from the atmosphere (Pugh et al., 2019b). Global terrestrial ecosystems comprised a net sink of -1.9 ± 1.1 Gt yr -1 from 2010 to 2019 (Friedlingstein et al., 2020), mainly due to growth in forests (Harris et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2021a), mitigating ~31% of global emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and LUC (Friedlingstein et al., 2020)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.4.4.1_p4,Deforestation,"In summary, terrestrial ecosystems contain 3000–4000 GtC in vegetation, permafrost and soils, three to five times the amount of carbon in unextracted fossil fuels and 4.4 times the carbon currently in the atmosphere (robust evidence, high agreement ). Tropical deforestation, the draining and burning of peatlands and other LULCCs emit 0.9–2.3 GtC yr -1, ~15% of the global emissions from fossil fuels and ecosystems (robust evidence, high agreement ). Terrestrial ecosystems currently remove more carbon from the atmosphere (-3.4±0.9 Gt yr -1) than they emit (+1.6±0.7 Gt yr -1), a net sink of -1.9±1.1 Gt yr -1 (Friedlingstein et al., 2020) . Thus, tropical rainforests, Arctic permafrost and other ecosystems provide the global ecosystem service of naturally preventing carbon from contributing to climate change (high confidence)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.4.4.3_p2,Deforestation,"National parks and other protected areas which, in June 2021, covered 15.7% of global terrestrial area (UNEP-WCMC et al., 2021) contain ~90 GtC in vegetation and ~150 GtC in soil (one-fifth and one-tenth, respectively, of global stocks) and remove carbon from the atmosphere at a rate of ~0.5 Gt yr -1 (one-sixth of global removals) (Melillo et al., 2016). The most strictly protected areas contain carbon at higher densities, but illegal deforestation and fires in some protected areas emit 38 ± 17 Mt yr -1 globally (Collins and Mitchard, 2017). In the Amazon, protected areas store more than half of the above-ground vegetation carbon stocks of the region, but account for only one-tenth of net emissions (Walker et al., 2020). Conservation of high biodiversity areas, particularly in protected areas, protects ecosystem carbon, prevents emissions to the atmosphere and reduces the magnitude of climate change (high confidence)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.4.4.4_p1,Deforestation,"Most global deforestation is occurring in tropical forests (Pan et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2015; Houghton and Nassikas, 2017; Erb et al., 2018a; Li et al., 2018; Harris et al., 2021), primarily as a result of clearing for agricultural land (Hong et al., 2021), causing primary tropical forest to comprise a net source of carbon from 2001 to 2019: emissions to the atmosphere 0.6 GtC yr -1, removals from the atmosphere -0.5 GtC yr -1 and net 0.1 GtC yr -1 (Harris et al., 2021). While wildfires emitted an average of 0.4 ± 0.2 GtC yr -1 from 1997 to 2016 (van der Werf et al., 2017), individual fire seasons can emit the same magnitude, such as the 0.4 GtC from the Amazon fires of 2007 (Aragao et al., 2018), the 0.5 GtC from the Amazon fires of 2015–2016 (Berenguer et al., 2021) and the 0.2 Gt from the Australia fires of 2019–2020 (Shiraishi and Hirata, 2021). Wildfires thus account for up to one-third of annual average ecosystem carbon emissions, while major fire seasons can emit up to two-thirds of global ecosystem carbon (medium evidence, medium agreement )."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.4.4.4_p3,Deforestation;carbon sink,"The Amazon as a whole was a net carbon emitter in the period 2003–2008 (Exbrayat and Williams, 2015; Yang et al., 2018b), primarily due to the expansion of agricultural and livestock areas, which caused over two-thirds of deforestation from 1990 to 2005 (De Sy et al., 2015; De Sy et al., 2019). Four sites in the Amazon also showed net carbon emissions in the period 2010–2018, from deforestation and fire (Gatti et al., 2021). In the Amazon, deforestation emitted 0.17 ± 0.05 GtC yr -1 from 2001 to 2015 (Silva Junior et al., 2020) while fires emitted 0.12 ± 0.14 GtC yr -1 from 2003 to 2015 (Aragao et al., 2018). An analysis of the Amazon carbon loss from deforestation and degradation estimated a loss of 0.5 Gt yr -1 in the period 2010 -2019, with degradation accounting for three-quarters (Qin et al., 2021). Intact old-growth Amazon rainforest has been a net carbon sink from 2000 to 2010 (-0.45 Gt yr -1, min. 0.31, max. 0.57) (Hubau et al., 2020) but may have become a net carbon source in 2010–2019 (0.67 Gt, for the entire period, uncertainty not reported) (Qin et al., 2021). These factors combined—recent impacts of climate change on undisturbed forest, coupled with deforestation and agricultural expansion, along with associated intentional burning—have caused Amazon rainforest to become an overall net carbon emitter  (medium confidence). "
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.4.4.4_p4,Deforestation;carbon sink,"In Indonesia and Malaysia, draining and burning of peat swamp forests for oil palm plantations emitted 60–260 MtC yr -1 from 1990 to 2015, converting peatlands in that period from a carbon sink to a carbon source (Miettinen et al., 2017; Wijedasa et al., 2018; Cooper et al., 2020). Deforestation of mangrove forests caused 10–30% of deforestation emissions in Indonesia from 1980 to 2005 (Donato et al., 2011; Murdiyarso et al., 2015), even though mangroves comprised only 3% of Indonesia primary forest area in 2000 (Margono et al., 2014; Murdiyarso et al., 2015)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.4.4.4_p7,Deforestation,"Tropical deforestation, the draining and burning of peatlands and the thawing of Arctic permafrost due to climate change have caused these ecosystems to emit more carbon to the atmosphere than they naturally remove through vegetation growth (high confidence)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.4.5.1_p1,Deforestation;carbon sink,"The difference between photosynthesis by plants (gross primary productivity, GPP) and plant energy use through respiration is the net growth of plants (NPP), which removes CO2 from the atmosphere and mitigates emissions from deforestation and other LUCs (Section 2.4.4.4). Global terrestrial NPP has exceeded emissions due to land use since the early 2000s, making terrestrial ecosystems a net carbon sink (Friedlingstein et al., 2020)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#FAQ 2.3_p6,Deforestation,"In other regions, wildfires are also burning wider areas and occurring more often. This is consistent with climate change, but analyses have not yet shown if climate change is more important than other factors. In the Amazon, deforestation by companies, farmers and herders who cut down and intentionally burn rainforests to expand agricultural fields and pastures causes wildfires even in relatively moister years. Drought exacerbates these fires. In Australia, much of the southeastern part of the continent has experienced extreme wildfire years, but analyses suggest that El Niño, a heat phenomenon that cycles up and down periodically, is more important than long-term climate change. In Indonesia, intentional burning of rainforests for oil palm plantations and El Niño seem to be more important than long-term climate change. In Mediterranean Europe, fire suppression seems to have prevented any increasing trend in burned area but the suppression and abandonment of agricultural lands have allowed fuel to build up in some areas and contribute to major fires in years of extreme heat. In Canada and Siberia, wildfires are now burning more often in permafrost areas where fire was rare, but analyses are lacking regarding the relative influence of climate change. For the world as a whole, satellite data indicate that the vast amount of land converted from forest to farmland in the period 1998–2015 actually decreased the total burned area. Nevertheless, the evidence from the forests of western North America shows that human-caused climate change has, at least on one continent, clearly driven increases in wildfire."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.5_p7,Deforestation,"Terrestrial ecosystems sequester and store globally critical stocks of carbon, but these stocks are at risk from deforestation and climate change (high confidence). Tropical deforestation and the draining and burning of peatlands produce almost all of the carbon emissions from LULCC. In the Arctic, increased temperatures have thawed permafrost at numerous sites, dried some areas and increased fires, causing net emissions of carbon from soils (high confidence) (Sections 2.4.4.4, 2.5.3.4)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#box-2.1_p1,Deforestation,"To assess future climate change impacts on ecosystems, we use models to project their future distribution. Comparing the trends in the observed changes against the projections can help assess the strength of the model projections. In this box, we compare observed trends of changes in ecosystem structure to projections highlighted in previous IPCC reports, specifically AR3 (IPCC, 2001), AR4 (Fischlin et al., 2007) and AR5 (Settele et al., 2014). We use this to assess how well the projections are matching up with observed changes. The map represents studies documenting observed changes in common plant functional groups (e.g., trees, grasses and shrubs). Studies documenting changes in plant functional groups were collated from published papers in natural and semi-natural areas. Studies were included if climate change or interactions between climate change and land use showed a causal link to the observed change (Table SM2.4). Studies were excluded if the changes were only from landscape/land use transformation (e.g., deforestation). In each paper, we recorded the geographical location and type of functional change, and noted the causes. Observed changes are plotted onto a biome map derived from the WWF ecoregions database (Olson et al., 2001). Trends in changing plant functional types are good indicators of potential biome shifts and are used to assess how observations match up with projections."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.3.1.1_p1,Deforestation;weather,"In 2009, deforestation, agricultural expansion, overgrazing and urbanisation exposed one-third of the global protected area (6 million km 2) to intense human pressure, a 6% increase from 1993 (Venter et al., 2016; Jones et al., 2018). The exposure to observed climate change has not yet been quantified for protected areas globally, but research has analysed the spatial patterns and magnitudes of observed changes for the 360,000 km 2 system of US national parks (Gonzalez et al., 2018) including the first national park in the world. From 1895 to 2010, mean annual temperature of the US national park area increased at a rate of 1°C ± 0.2°C per century, double the rate of the whole USA, and precipitation decreased in 12% of the national park area, compared with 4% for the whole USA, due to a high fraction of US national park area being in the Arctic, at high elevations, and in the arid southwestern USA (Gonzalez et al., 2018). In addition, analyses of weather-station measurements in and near six South African national parks found that the maximum temperature increased at a rate of 0.024°C ± 0.003°C yr -1 from 1960 to 2010 (Van Wilgen et al., 2016). While a substantial fraction of global protected area has been exposed to observed changes in human land cover, the global exposure to observed climate change is unquantified."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.3.1.2_p2,Deforestation,"Projections indicate greater exposure of tropical rainforests, shrublands and grasslands, temperate conifer forests and grasslands, and tundra to novel climates (Hoffmann et al., 2019b; Elsen et al., 2020). A climate change scenario of ~3.5°C temperature increase by 2100 could expose 32% of the protected area in humid tropical forests (1.6 million km 2 in 2000) to climate that would be novel to humid tropical-forest protected areas; by 2050, the climate currently present in humid tropical-forest protected areas could disappear from 0.6 million km 2 (12% of the current total area) (Tabor et al., 2018). High rates of deforestation and climate change combined could expose 2% of the humid tropical-forest protected area (Tabor et al., 2018). Regional analyses under RCP8.5 also project the substantial disappearance of the current climate in protected areas in Bolivia, Chile and Peru (Fuentes-Castillo et al., 2020), Canada, Mexico and the USA (Batllori et al., 2017; Holsinger et al., 2019), China (Zomer et al., 2015), Europe (Nila et al., 2019) and Indonesia (Scriven et al., 2015). Projected climate change could expose an extensive part of the global protected area to disappearing and novel climate conditions (high confidence) (Cross-Chapter Paper 1)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.3.2.2_p2,Deforestation;forest dieback,"In the Amazon, climate change under RCP8.5, combined with high deforestation, could double the area of high fire probability (Fonseca et al., 2019), double the burned area by 2050 (Brando et al., 2020), increase the burned area by 400–2800% by 2100 (Le Page et al., 2017) and increase fire intensity by 90% (De Faria et al., 2017). Lower GHG emissions (RCP4.5) and reduced deforestation could reduce the risk of fires to a one-fifth increase in the area of high fire probability (Fonseca et al., 2019) and a 100–500% increase in burned area by 2100 (Le Page et al., 2017). Moreover, increased fire, deforestation and drought, acting via vegetation–atmosphere feedbacks, increase the risk of extensive forest dieback and potential biome shifts of up to half of the Amazon rainforest to grassland, a tipping point that could release an amount of carbon that would substantially increase global emissions (Oyama and Nobre, 2003; Sampaio et al., 2007; Lenton et al., 2008; Nepstad et al., 2008; Malhi et al., 2009; Settele et al., 2014; Lyra et al., 2016; Zemp et al., 2017a; Zemp et al., 2017b; Brando et al., 2020). Continued climate change, combined with deforestation, increases risks of wildfire and extensive forest dieback in the Amazon rainforest (robust evidence, high agreement )."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.3.2.2_p7,Deforestation,"In summary, under a high-emission scenario that increases global temperature 4°C by 2100, climate change could increase the global burned area by 50–70% and the global mean fire frequency by ~30%, with increases on one- to two-thirds and decreases on one-fifth of global land (medium confidence). Lower emissions that would limit the global temperature increase to <2°C would reduce projected increases of burned area to ~35% and projected increases of fire frequency to ~20% (medium confidence). Increased wildfire, combined with erosion due to deforestation, could degrade water supplies (high confidence). For ecosystems with an historically low fire frequency, a projected 4°C rise in global temperature increases risks of fire, contributing to potential tree mortality and conversion of over half the Amazon rainforest to grassland and thawing of the Arctic permafrost that could release 11–200 GtC that could substantially exacerbate climate change  (medium confidence)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.3.3_p1,Deforestation;ecosystem services,"Under continued climate change, increased temperature, aridity, drought, wildfire (Section 2.5.3.2) and insect infestations (Section 2.4.4.3.3) will tend to increase tree mortality across many parts of the world (McDowell et al., 2020). Loss of boreal and temperate forest to fire, wind and bark beetles could cause more negative than positive effects for most ecosystem services, including carbon storage to regulate climate change (Sections 2.4.4.3, 2.5.2.6, 2.5.2.7, 2.5.3.4), water supply for people (Section 2.5.3.6.1), timber production and other forest products (Chapter 5) and protection from hazards (Thom and Seidl, 2016). In addition, deforestation in tropical and temperate forests can increase local temperatures by 0.3°C–2°C (Hesslerová et al., 2018; Lejeune et al., 2018; Zeppetello et al., 2020) and this effect can extend up to 50 km (Cohn et al., 2019)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.3.3_p2,Deforestation;forest dieback,"In Amazon rainforests, the relatively lower buffering capacity for plant moisture during drought increases the risk of tree mortality and, combined with increased heat from climate change and fire from deforestation, the possibility of a tipping point of extensive forest dieback and a biome shift to grassland (Oyama and Nobre, 2003; Sampaio et al., 2007; Lenton et al., 2008; Nepstad et al., 2008; Malhi et al., 2009; Salazar and Nobre, 2010; Settele et al., 2014; Lyra et al., 2016; Zemp et al., 2017b; Brando et al., 2020). This could occur at a 4°C–5°C temperature increase above that of the pre-industrial period (Salazar and Nobre, 2010). Under RCP8.5, half the Amazon tropical evergreen forest could turn into grassland through drought-induced tree mortality and wildfire, but lower emissions (RCP4.5) could limit this loss to ~5% (Lyra et al., 2016). The decline in precipitation due to reduced evapotranspiration inputs after forest loss could cause additional Amazon forest loss of one-quarter to one-third (Zemp et al., 2017a). Similarly, in Guinean tropical deciduous forest in Africa, climate change under RCP8.5 could increase mortality 700% by 2100 or 400% under lower emissions (RCP4.5; (Claeys et al., 2019). These projections indicate risks of climate change-induced tree mortality reducing tropical forest areas in Africa and South America by up to half under a 4°C increase above the pre-industrial period, but a lower projection of a 2°C increase could limit the projected increases in tree mortality (robust evidence, high agreement )."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.3.5_p1,Deforestation;weather;albedo,"The possibility of feedbacks and interactions between climate drivers and biological systems or ecological processes was identified as a significant emerging issue in AR5, and has since also been highlighted in the SRCCL and the SR1.5. It is virtually certain that land cover changes affect regional and global climate through changes to albedo, evapotranspiration and roughness (very high confidence) (Perugini et al., 2017). There is growing evidence that biosphere-related climate processes are being affected by climate change in combination with disturbance and LULCC (high confidence) (Jia et al., 2019). It is virtually certain that land surface change caused by disturbances such as forest fires, hurricanes, phenological changes, insect outbreaks and deforestation affect carbon, water and energy exchanges, thereby influencing weather and climate (very high confidence) (Table 2.4; Figure 2.10) (Bright et al., 2013; Brovkin et al., 2013; Naudts et al., 2016; Prăvălie, 2018)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.3.6.1_p3,Deforestation,"Net effects of deforestation and afforestation on runoff and water supply depend on local factors, leading to conflicting evidence of effects of land cover change (Ellison et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2021b), but combinations of climate change and deforestation are projected to reduce water flows (Olivares et al., 2019). In southern Thailand, the combination of the conversion of forest to rubber plantations and a one-third increase in rainfall could increase erosion and sediment load by 15% (Trisurat et al., 2016). In the watershed that supplies São Paulo, Brazil, afforestation could increase water quantity and quality (Ferreira et al., 2019). In most regions with dry or Mediterranean subtropical climates, projected climate change can reduce surface water and groundwater resources (Doell et al., 2015). In northeast Spain, reduced precipitation and vegetation cover under the high-emissions scenario of a 3.5°C temperature increase could reduce drinking water supplies by half by 2100 (Bangash et al., 2013)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6 _p3,Deforestation;ecosystem services,"Most of this section therefore focusses on human interventions to build the resilience of ecosystems, enable species to survive or to adjust management to climate change. Vulnerability is, in many cases, exacerbated by the degraded state of many ecosystems as a result of human exploitation and LUC, leading to the fragmentation of habitats, the loss of species and impaired ecosystem function. This interaction between climate change and environmental degradation means that protecting ecosystems in a natural or near-natural state will be an important pre-requisite for maintaining resilience and give many species the best chance of persisting in a changed climate (Belote et al., 2017; Arneth et al., 2020; Ferrier et al., 2020; França et al., 2020). Protection from degradation, deforestation and exploitation is also essential to maintain critical ecosystem services, including carbon storage and sequestration and water supply (Dinerstein et al., 2020; Pörtner et al., 2021)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.7.2_p1,Deforestation;invasive species,"A challenge for future projections that continues from previous IPCC reports is accurately characterising and quantifying the interactions of climate change vs. other, non-climate factors that cause ecological change, including LULCC (particularly deforestation, agricultural expansion, and urbanisation) and air and water pollution. Interactions can be particularly complex for invasive species, pests, pathogens and human infectious diseases. Modelling of risks at the species level requires comprehensive databases of the physiological, life-history, and reproduction of individual species, and modeling the impact of changes in species’ compositions requires a mechanistic understanding of functional traits relevant to ecosystem integrity, functioning and resilience to climate change. Taxa that particularly lack this basis for model projections include fungi and bacteria. For numerous plant and animal species, research into genotypic and phenotypic diversity as a source of ecosystem resilience would inform projections of risk."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.2_p7,Deforestation,"The negative impacts of climate change in the region are exacerbated by deforestation and land degradation attributed mainly to expansion and intensification of agriculture and cattle ranching, usually under insecure-tenure land.

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.3.2.4_p13,Deforestation,"Species distribution is changing in dry lowland forests, where deforestation is the more intense driver and climate change is intensely acting (Aguirre et al., 2017; Manchego et al., 2017). Extinctions in amphibians have been related to temperature rises acting in synergy with diseases (Catenazzi et al., 2014). The fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis successfully accompanied and caused disease in high-elevation Andean frogs as they expanded their ranges to 5200–5400 m (Seimon et al., 2017). Several groups of freshwater species of the tropical Andes represent 35% of threatened freshwater species in the world (Gardner and Finlayson, 2018).

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.3.3.4_p2,Deforestation;slash and burn,"Indigenous Peoples and resource-dependent rural communities in the Amazon have been impacted over the last decade by extreme drought and flood events in various dimensions of their livelihoods (Pinho et al., 2015). Food security has been strongly impacted since it is based on fishing and small-scale agriculture, two sectors highly vulnerable to climate change. During extreme events, fishing decreases due to limited access to fishing grounds (medium confidence: low evidence, high agreement ) (Figure 12.9) (Pinho et al., 2015; Camacho Guerreiro et al., 2016. Overfishing, deforestation and dam construction are a threat to fishing in the sub-region (Lopes et al., 2019) and therefore contribute to exacerbating the impacts of climate change. Small-scale agriculture practices (e.g., floodplain agriculture and slash and burn) are highly coupled with natural hydrological cycles and therefore severely affected by extreme events (Figure 12.9) (Cochran et al., 2016). Livelihoods are also impacted by disruptions in land and river transport, restrictions in drinking water access, increased incidence of forest fires and disease outbreaks (medium confidence: medium evidence, high agreement ) (Figure 12.9) (Marengo et al., 2013; Pinho et al., 2015; Marengo and Espinoza, 2016; Marengo et al., 2018).

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.3.4.2_p2,Deforestation,"It is not surprising, therefore, that while SAM is the region in CSA that experienced the highest temperature increase in the last century, it is where most of the fire spots in the sub-continent are located, owing also to the prevalent use of fires in pasturelands (medium confidence: medium evidence, high agreement ) (Bowman et al., 2009). Recently, da Silva Junior et al. (2020) reported 6,708,350 and 6,188,606 fire foci in Cerrado and Amazonia, between 1999 and 2018, corresponding to 80% of the total observed in Brazil. The occurrence of extreme droughts has affected the carbon and water cycles in large areas of the Amazon rainforest (high confidence) (Lapola et al., 2014; Agudelo et al., 2019), in particular in its southern and eastern portions, where deforestation rates are higher. The loss of carbon in the Amazon region considering the combined effect of land use change in the southern portion of the region bordering Cerrado and Pantanal and global carbon emission scenarios can be as high as 38% at 4°C of warming, but limited to 8% if the Paris Agreement limit of 1.5°C is achieved (medium confidence, medium evidence, high agreement ) (Burton et al., 2021), driving the region to be a net carbon source to the atmosphere (Gatti et al., 2021). A recent extreme drought was estimated to affect the photosynthetic capacity of 400,000 km 2 of the forest (Anderson et al., 2018b); nevertheless, there are considerable uncertainties regarding the effects of CO2 fertilisation in tropical forests and ecosystems (medium confidence: medium evidence, high agreement ) (Sampaio et al., 2021). Extreme drought events increase forest vulnerability to fire, directly affecting the biodiversity and the forest structure and its plant species distribution (high agreement ) (Brando et al., 2014). Production sectors are also exposed. SAM is pointed out as a region where agricultural production will be especially impacted by climate change, affecting the production of annual crops, fruits and livestock (medium confidence: medium evidence, high agreement ) (Lapola et al., 2014; Zilli et al., 2020)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.3.4.3_p3,Deforestation,"The combined effects of extreme climate events and ecosystem fragmentation, for example, by deforestation or fire, lead to changes in forest structure, with the death of taller trees and reduction in diversity of plant species, loss of productivity and carbon storage (high agreement ) (Brando et al., 2014; Reis et al., 2018). The rise of a large-scale soybean agroindustry in the early 2000s led to a faster increase in human development indicators in some regions, tightly linked to the agricultural production chain (high confidence) (Richards et al., 2015). Such a development also came at considerable cost to the environment (e.g., Neill et al. 2013) and the regional climate, even though a moratorium implemented in 2006 on new soy plantations on deforested areas reduced deforestation by a factor of five (high confidence) (Macedo et al., 2012; Kastens et al., 2017). The same sort of supply chain interventions along with incentive-based public policies applied to the beef supply chain could minimise the need for agricultural expansion in the SAM deforestation frontier (medium confidence: medium evidence, high agreement ) (Nepstad et al., 2014; Pompeu et al., 2021)."

Extreme floods in the southern Amazon and Bolivian Amazon floodplains were described and related to the exceptionally warm sub-tropical South Atlantic ocean (high confidence) (Espinoza et al., 2014), causing high economic impacts (losses in crop and livestock production and infrastructure) and number of fatalities (very high confidence)  (Ovando et al., 2016). In contrast, declines in stream flow, particularly in the dry season, expressed by the ratio of runoff to rainfall, are observed for the southern part of the Amazon basin (high evidence) (Molina-Carpio et al., 2017; Espinoza et al., 2019b; Heerspink et al., 2020). Observed precipitation reduction in the Cerrado region impacted main water supply reservoirs for important cities in the Brazilian central region, leading to a water crisis in 2016/2017 (Government of Brazil, 2020) and affecting hydropower energy generation (Ribeiro Neto et al., 2016). Modelling studies project decreases in the river discharge rate on the order of 27% for the Tapajós basin and 53% for the Tocantins-Araguaia basin for the end of the century, which may affect freshwater biodiversity, navigation and generation of hydroelectric power (medium confidence: medium evidence, high agreement ) (Marcovitch et al., 2010; Mohor et al., 2015). This region also holds one of the largest floodplains in the world, the Pantanal. The climatic connection of Pantanal regions to the Amazon, and the influence of deforestation in local precipitation (Marengo et al., 2018) has implications for conservation of ecosystem services and water security in Pantanal (high confidence) (Bergier et al., 2018). Impacts of extreme drought, with increasing numbers of dry days and the peak of fire foci, were recently reported (robust evidence) (Lázaro et al., 2020; Garcia et al., 2021). The projected impacts of climate change will lead to profound changes in the annual flood dynamics for Pantanal wetlands, altering ecosystem functioning and severely affecting biodiversity (high confidence) (Thielen et al., 2020; Marengo et al., 2021)."

It is estimated that more than 10 million people are exposed to forest fires in the deforestation arc, a region comprising several Brazilian states in the southern and western parts of the Amazon rainforest, with several impacts on human health including potential exacerbation of the COVID-19 crisis in Amazonia (medium confidence: medium evidence, high agreement ) (de Oliveira et al., 2020) (Table 12.5). Increases in hospital admissions, asthma, DNA damage and lung cell death due to the inhalation of fine particulate matter  represent an increase in public health system costs (high confidence) (Ignotti et al., 2010; Silva et al., 2013; de Oliveira Alves et al., 2017; Machin et al., 2019). The patchy landscape created by forest clearing contributes to a rising risk of zoonotic disease emergence by increasing interactions between wildlife, livestock and humans (medium confidence: low evidence, medium agreement ) (Dobson et al., 2020; Tollefson, 2020). Recent studies also suggest an influence of climate change in zoonotic diseases, such as Orthohantavirus and Chapare viral infections, rodent-borne diseases, in some areas of Bolivia (Escalera-Antezana et al., 2020a; Escalera-Antezana et al., 2020b). Extreme fluctuations in Amazon River levels were associated with a significant increase in the incidence of diarrhoea, leptospirosis and dermatitis (de Souza Hacon et al., 2019; Government of Brazil, 2020). According to a comprehensive characterisation of future heatwaves and alternative RCPs scenarios, Brazilian urban areas in the SAM region are projected to face increasing related mortality from 400% to 500% in the period 2031–2080 compared to the period 1971–2020, under the highest emission scenario and high-variant population scenario (medium confidence: low evidence, medium agreement ) (Guo et al., 2018).

With 15% of the world’s land area, it receives 29% of global precipitation and has 33% of globally available renewable resources (Flachsbarth et al., 2015). Agricultural commodities (coffee, bananas, sugar, soybean, corn, sugarcane, beef livestock) are some of the highest users of ecosystem resources such as land, water, nutrients and technology. These exports have gained importance in the past two decades as international trade and globalisation of markets have shaped the global agri-food system. However continuous overuse of the environment might account for resource depletion (deforestation, land degradation, nutrient depletion, pollution), affecting the natural capital base. The effects of climate change on humans, via ecological systems, exacerbate the impact related to the depletion of ecosystem services (Scholes, 2016; IPBES, 2018b; Castaneda Sanchez et al., 2019; Clerici et al., 2019; Tellman et al., 2020; Pacheco et al., 2021)."

cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#box-3.4_p19,Deforestation,"Focusing on cumulative emissions, the right-hand panel of Figure 3.12b shows that for high-end scenarios (C6–C7), most emissions originate from fossil fuels, with a smaller contribution from net deforestation. For C5 and lower, there is also a negative contribution to emissions from both AFOLU emissions and energy systems. For the energy systems, these negative emissions originate from bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), while for AFOLU, they originate from reforestation and afforestation. For C3–C5, reforestation has a larger CDR contribution than BECCS, mostly due to considerably lower costs (Rochedo et al. 2018). For C1 and C2, the tight carbon budgets imply in many scenarios more CDR use (Riahi et al. 2021). Please note that net negative emissions are not so relevant for peak-temperature targets, and thus the C1 category, but CDR can still be used to offset the remaining positive emissions (Riahi et al. 2021). While positive CO2 emissions from fossil fuels are significantly reduced, inertia and hard-to-abate sectors imply that in many C1–C3 scenarios, around 800–1000 GtCO2 of net positive cumulative CO2 emissions remain. This is consistent with literature estimates that current infrastructure is associated with 650 GtCO2 (best estimate) if operated until the end of its lifetime (Tong et al. 2019). These numbers are considerably above the estimated carbon budgets for 1.5°C estimated in AR6 WGI, hence explaining CDR reliance (either to offset emissions immediately or later in time)."

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.3.4_p5,carbon sequestration;albedo,"For tropical and subtropical regions, the interplay of atmospheric CO2 with precipitation and temperature becomes of particular importance for future carbon uptake, since in warm and dry environments, elevated CO2 fosters plants with C3 photosynthesis and enhances their water-use efficiency relative to C4 species (Moncrieff et al., 2014a; Midgley and Bond, 2015; Knorr et al., 2016a). As a consequence, enhanced woody cover is expected to occur in the future, especially in mesic savannas, while in xeric savannas an increase in woody cover would occur in regions with enhanced precipitation (Criado et al., 2020). Even though semiarid regions have dominated the global trend in land CO2 uptake in recent decades (Ahlström et al., 2015), so far, most studies that investigated future climate change impacts on savanna ecosystems have concentrated on changes in the extent of land area affected (2.5.2.5) rather than on carbon cycling, with medium confidence for increasing woody cover:grass ratios (Moncrieff et al., 2014a; Midgley and Bond, 2015; Moncrieff et al., 2016; Criado et al., 2020). Increases in woody vegetation in what is now grass-dominated would possibly come with a carbon benefit, for instance, it was found that a broad range of future climate and CO2 changes would enhance vegetation carbon storage on Australian savannas (Scheiter et al., 2015). Results from a number of field experiments indicate, however, that impacts on total ecosystem carbon storage may be smaller due to a loss in below-ground carbon (Coetsee et al., 2013; Wigley et al., 2020). Nunez et al. (2021) critique existing incentives to promote the invasion of non-native trees into treeless areas as a means of carbon sequestration, raising doubts about the effects on fire, albedo, biodiversity and water yield (see Box 2.2)."

The time scales associated with these options indicate that carbon sinks in terrestrial vegetation and soil systems can be maintained or enhanced so as to contribute towards long-term mitigation ( high confidence); however, many AFOLU mitigation options do not continue to sequester carbon indefinitely (Fuss et al. 2018; de Coninck et al. 2018; IPCC 2019a) (AR6 WGIII Chapter 7). In the very long term (the latter part of the century and beyond), it will become more challenging to continue to enhance vegetation and soil carbon stocks, so that the associated carbon sinks could diminish or even become sources ( high confidence) (de Coninck et al. 2018; IPCC 2019a) (AR6 WGI Chapter 5). Sustainable forest management, including harvest and forest regeneration, can help to remediate and slow any decline in the forest carbon sink, for example by restoring degraded forest areas, and so go some way towards addressing the issue of sink saturation (IPCC 2019) (AR6 WGI Chapter 5; and Chapter 7 in this report). The accumulated carbon resulting from mitigation options that enhance carbon sequestration (e.g., reforestation, soil carbon sequestration) is also at risk of future loss due to disturbances (e.g., fire, pests) (Boysen et al. 2017; de Coninck et al. 2018; Fuss et al. 2018; Smith et al. 2019; IPCC 2019a; Anderegg et al. 2020) (AR6 WGI Chapter 5).

cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.4.7_p2,carbon sequestration,"Very few studies and pathways include other CDR options (Table 3.5). Pathways with DACCS include potentially large removal from DACCS (up to 37 GtCO2 yr –1 in 2100) in the second half of the century (Chen and Tavoni 2013; Marcucci et al. 2017; Realmonte et al. 2019; Fuhrman et al. 2020, 2021; Shayegh et al. 2021; Akimoto et al. 2021) and reduced cost of mitigation (Bistline and Blanford 2021; Strefler et al. 2021a). At large scales, the use of DACCS has substantial implications for energy use, emissions, land, and water; substituting DACCS for BECCS results in increased energy usage, but reduced land-use change and water withdrawals (Fuhrman et al., 2020, 2021) (Chapter 12.3.2; AR6 WGI Chapter 5). The level of deployment of DACCS is sensitive to the rate at which it can be scaled up, the climate goal or carbon budget, the underlying socio-economic scenario, the availability of other decarbonisation options, the cost of DACCS and other mitigation options, and the strength of carbon-cycle feedbacks (Chen and Tavoni 2013; Fuss et al. 2013; Honegger and Reiner 2018; Realmonte et al. 2019; Fuhrman et al. 2020; Bistline and Blanford 2021; Fuhrman et al. 2021; Strefler et al. 2021a) (AR6 WGI Chapter 5). Since DACCS consumes energy, its effectiveness depends on the type of energy used; the use of fossil fuels would reduce its sequestration efficiency (Creutzig et al. 2019; NASEM 2019; Babacan et al. 2020). Studies with additional CDR options in addition to DACCS (e.g., enhanced weathering, BECCS, afforestation, biochar, and soil carbon sequestration) find that CO2 removal is spread across available options (Holz et al. 2018; Strefler et al. 2021a).

Chapter 8 identifies three overarching mitigation strategies with the largest potential to decrease current, and avoid future, urban emissions: (i) reducing or changing urban energy and material use towards more sustainable production and consumption across all sectors including through spatial planning and infrastructure that supports compact, walkable urban form (Section 8.4.2); (ii) decarbonise through electrification of the urban energy system, and switch to net-zero-emissions resources (i.e., low-carbon infrastructure) (Section 8.4.3); and (iii) enhance carbon sequestration through urban green and blue infrastructure (e.g., green roofs, urban forests and street trees), which can also offer multiple co-benefits like reducing ground temperatures and supporting public health and well-being (Section 8.4.4). Integrating these mitigation strategies across sectors, geographic scales, and levels of governance will yield the greatest emissions savings (Sections 8.4 and 8.5)."

cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.4.1.2_p14,Stratospheric aerosol injection,"In the context of mitigation pathways, only a few studies have examined solar radiation modification (SRM), typically focusing on Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (Arinoa et al. 2016; Emmerling and Tavoni 2018a,b; Heutel et al. 2018; Helwegen et al. 2019; Rickels et al. 2020; Belaia et al. 2021). These studies find that substantial mitigation is required to limit warming to a given level, even if SRM is available (Moreno-Cruz and Smulders 2017; Emmerling and Tavoni 2018b; Belaia et al. 2021). SRM may reduce some climate impacts, reduce peak temperatures, lower mitigation costs, and extend the time available to achieve mitigation; however, SRM does not address ocean acidification and may involve risks to crop yields, economies, human health, or ecosystems (AR6 WGII Chapter 16; AR6 WGI TS and Chapter 5; SR1.5 SPM; and Cross-Working Group Box 4 in Chapter 14 of this report). There are also significant uncertainties surrounding SRM, including uncertainties on the costs and risks, which can substantially alter the amount of SRM used in modelled pathways (Tavoni et al. 2017; Heutel et al. 2018; IPCC 2018; Helwegen et al. 2019; NASEM 2021). Furthermore, the degree of international cooperation can influence the amount of SRM deployed in scenarios, with uncoordinated action resulting in larger SRM deployment and consequently larger risks/impacts from SRM (Emmerling and Tavoni 2018a). Bridging research and governance involves consideration of the full range of societal choices and ramifications (Sugiyama et al. 2018). More information on SRM, including the caveats, risks, uncertainties, and governance issues is found in AR6 WGI Chapter 4; AR6 WGIII Chapter 14; and Cross-Working Group Box 4 in Chapter 14 of this report."

cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.4.1.3_p1,Biofuels,"Mitigation in one sector can be dependent upon mitigation in another sector, or may involve trade-offs between sectors. Mitigation in energy demand often includes electrification (Pietzcker et al. 2014; Luderer et al. 2018; Sharmina et al. 2020; DeAngelo et al. 2021), however such pathways only result in reduced emissions if  the electricity sector is decarbonised (Zhang and Fujimori 2020) (Chapter 12). Relatedly, the mitigation potential of some sectors (e.g., transportation) depends on the decarbonisation of liquid fuels, for example, through biofuels (Pietzcker et al. 2014; Wise et al. 2017; Sharmina et al. 2020) (Chapter 12). In other cases, mitigation in one sector results in reduced emissions in another sector. For example, increased recycling can reduce primary resource extraction; planting trees or green roofs in urban areas can reduce the energy demand associated with space cooling (Chapter 12)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter03#3.7.2.2_p2,Biofuels,"Mitigating climate change while ensuring that food security is not adversely affected requires a range of different strategies and interventions ( high confidence). Fujimori et al. (2018) explore possible economic solutions to these unintended impacts of mitigation (e.g., agricultural subsidies, food aid, and domestic reallocation of income) with an additional small (<0.1%) change in global GDP. Targeted food-security support is needed to shield impoverished and vulnerable people from the risk of hunger that could be caused by the economic effects of policies narrowly focussed on climate objectives. Introducing more biofuels and careful selection of bioenergy feedstocks could also reduce negative impacts (FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO, 2017). Reconciling bioenergy demands with food and biodiversity, as well as competition for land and water, will require changes in food systems – agricultural intensification, open trade, less consumption of animal products and reduced food losses – and advanced biotechnologies (Henry et al. 2018; Xu et al. 2019)."

Estimates of carbon removals from remote sensing may provide more accurate estimates of boreal forest carbon balances than ESMs which overestimate regrowth after timber harvesting and other disturbance (Wang et al., 2021a). Mortality of the boreal forest in British Columbia from mountain pine beetle infestations converted 374,000 km 2 from a net carbon sink to a net carbon source (Kurz et al., 2008). Modelling suggests that a potential increase in water-use efficiency and regrowth could offset the losses in part of the forest mortality area (Giles-Hansen et al., 2021)."

It is expected that the carbon balance of peatlands globally will switch from sink to source in the near future (2020–2100), mainly because tropical peatland emissions, together with those from climate change-driven permafrost thaw, will likely surpass the carbon gain expected from climate change-driven enhanced plant productivity in northern high latitudes (Gallego-Sala et al., 2018; Chaudhary et al., 2020; Turetsky et al., 2020; Loisel et al., 2021) which are mainly caused by groundwater drawdown (robust evidence, medium agreement ) (Hirano et al., 2014; Brouns et al., 2015; Cobb et al., 2017; Itoh et al., 2017; Evans et al., 2021).

For CMIP3, there was reasonable agreement between the basin-scale patterns of salinity, with a comparatively fresher Pacific when contrasted to the salty Atlantic, and basin salinity maxima features aligning well with the corresponding atmospheric evaporation minus precipitation field (Durack et al., 2012). Similar features are also reproduced in CMIP5 along with realistic variability in the upper layers, but less variability than observations at 300 m and deeper, especially in the poorly sampled Antarctic region (Pierce et al., 2012). In a regional study, only considering the Indian Ocean, CMIP5 SSS was assessed and it was shown that model biases were primarily linked to biases in the precipitation field, with ocean circulation biases playing a secondary role (Fathrio et al., 2017a).

Mitigation pathways with 2030 emissions levels in the NDCS announced prior to COP26 consistently overshoot 1.5°C by 0.15°C–0.3°C. This leads to higher risks from climate change impacts during the time of overshoot compared to pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot (Schleussner et al. 2016a; Mengel et al. 2018; Hofmann et al. 2019; Lenton et al. 2019; Tachiiri et al. 2019; Drouet et al. 2021).

Pathways with earlier mitigation action bring higher long-term GDP than pathways reaching the same end-of-century temperature with weaker early action (Figure 3.34d). Comparing counterfactual history scenarios, Sanderson and O’Neill (2020) also find that delayed mitigation action leads to higher peak costs. Rogelj et al. (2019b) and Riahi et al. (2021) also show that pathways with earlier timing of net zero CO2 lead to higher transition costs but lower long-term mitigation costs, due to dynamic effects arising from lock-in avoidance and learning effects. For example, Riahi et al.(2021) find that for a 2°C target, the GDP losses (compared to a reference scenario without impacts from climate change) in 2100 are 5–70% lower in pathways that avoid net negative CO2 emissions and temperature overshoot than in pathways with overshoot. Accounting also for climate change damage, van der Wijst et al. (2021a) show that avoiding net negative emissions leads to a small increase in total discounted mitigation costs over 2020–2100, between 5% and 14% in their medium assumptions, but does not increase mitigation costs when damages are high and when using a low discount rate, and becomes economically attractive if damages are not fully reversible. The modelled cost-optimal balance of mitigation action over time strongly depends on the discount rate used to compute or evaluate mitigation pathways: lower discount rates favour earlier mitigation, reducing both temperature overshoot and reliance on net negative carbon emissions (Emmerling et al. 2019; Riahi et al. 2021). Mitigation pathways with weak early action corresponding to NDCs announced prior to COP26 in 2030 and strengthening action after 2030 to reach end-of-century temperature targets imply limited mitigation costs in 2030, compared to immediate global action pathways, but faster increase in costs post-2030, with implications for intergenerational equity (Aldy et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2016; Vrontisi et al. 2018). Emissions trading policies reduce global aggregate mitigation costs, in particular in the context of achieving NDCs (Fujimori et al. 2015, 2016a; Böhringer et al. 2021; Edmonds et al. 2021), and change the distribution of mitigation costs between regions and countries (Section 3.6.1.2)."

Extreme events are challenging to model because they are, by definition, rare, and often occur at spatial and temporal scales much finer than the resolution of climate models (Sillmann et al., 2017; Zscheischler et al., 2018). Additionally, the processes that cause extreme events often interact, as is the case for drought and heat events, and they are spatially and temporally dependent, for example, soil moisture and temperature (Vogel et al., 2017). Understanding feedbacks between land and atmosphere also remains limited. For example, positive feedbacks between soil and vegetation, or between evaporation, radiation and precipitation, are important in the preconditioning of extreme events such as heat waves and droughts, and can increase the severity and impact of such events (Miralles et al., 2019)."

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.3.5_p6,feedback;albedo,"Climate-induced shifts towards forests in what is currently tundra would be expected to reduce regional albedo especially in spring, but also during parts of winter when trees are snow-free (whereas tundra vegetation would be covered in snow), which amplifies warming regionally (high confidence) (Perugini et al., 2017; Jia et al., 2019). Trees would also enhance momentum absorption compared to low tundra vegetation, thus impacting surface–atmosphere mixing of latent and sensible heat fluxes (Jia et al., 2019). Boreal forests insulate and stabilize permafrost and reduce fluctuations of ground temperature: the amplitude of variation of ground surface temperatures was 28°C at a forested site, compared to 60°C in nearby grassland (Section 2.5.2.7) (Bonan, 1989; Stuenzi et al., 2021a; Stuenzi et al., 2021b). Likewise, a shift in moist tropical forests towards vegetation with drought-tolerant traits could possibly reduce evapotranspiration, increase albedo, alter heat transfer at the surface and lead to a negative feedback to precipitation (Section 2.5.2.6) (Jia et al., 2019). In savannas, restoration of woody vegetation has been shown to enhance cloud formation and precipitation in response to enhanced transpiration and turbulent mixing, leading to a positive feedback on woody cover (Syktus and McAlpine, 2016). While this has not yet been systematically explored, similar feedbacks might also emerge from a CO2-induced woody cover increase in savannas (low confidence) (Section 2.5.2.5)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.1_p5,feedback;ecosystem services,"There are a variety of mechanisms which promote the resilience of ecosystems through persistence, recovery and reorganisation (Falk et al., 2019). Changes in the balance of different plant species within a community can maintain the persistence of the community itself, maintaining its value as a habitat for other species and providing ecosystem services. In some cases, there are negative feedback mechanisms between biological and physical processes; for example, in peatlands, lowered water tables resulting from drier conditions can lead to reduced permeability of peat, increasing rates of water loss (Page and Baird, 2016). There are limits to this resilience and the concept of tipping points beyond which ecosystems change state, and returning to the original state has been subject of much recent research (van Nes et al., 2016). There is clear evidence that the degradation of ecosystems has reduced their resilience and that restoration can help to reduce risks to biodiversity and ecosystem services, discussed below (see Section 2.6.2, 2.6.3). However, as the rate of climate change increases, the limits of this approach will start to be reached, and losses (including some with potentially catastrophic consequences) cannot be prevented; this is discussed further in Section 2.6.6."

If conventional air-conditioning systems are widely deployed to provide cooling, energy use could rise significantly (van Ruijven et al. 2019; Bezerra et al. 2021; Falchetta and Mistry 2021), thus creating a positive feedback further increasing cooling demand. However, the overall emissions are barely altered by the changing energy demand composition with reductions in heating demand occurring simultaneously (Isaac and van Vuuren 2009; Labriet et al. 2015; McFarland et al. 2015; Clarke et al. 2018).

This global impact feeds back to cities through the exposure of infrastructure, people, and business to the impacts of climate-related hazards. Particularly in larger cities, this climate feedback is exacerbated by local choices in urban design, land use, building design, and human behaviour (Viguié et al. 2020) that shape local environmental conditions. Both the local and global combine to increase hazardousness. Certain configurations of urban form and their elements can add up to 2°C to warming; concretisation of open space can increase run-off, and building height and orientation influences wind direction and strength (see WGII Section 6.3 and WGIII Section 8.4.2)."

In other models, behaviour change in transport and residential energy use could reduce emissions by 2 GtCO2-eq in 2030 compared to 2019 (IEA 2020b) (Chapter 5). Voluntary behaviour change can support emissions reduction, but behaviours that are not convenient to change are unlikely to shift without changes to policy (Sköld et al. 2018). Cities can increase the capability of citizens to make sustainable choices by making these choices less onerous, through avenues such as changing urban form to increase locational and mobility options and providing feedback mechanisms to support socio-behavioural change."

Reductions in home energy use can be achieved by reducing floor area (0.5–3.0%), utilising more efficient appliances and lighting (2.7–5.0%), optimising thermostat settings (8.3–11%), using efficient heating and cooling technologies (6.7–10%), improving building insulation (2.9–4.0%), optimising clothes washing (5.0–5.7%), and optimising dishwashing (1–1.1%) (Levesque et al. 2019). Building standards and mandates could work towards making these options required or more readily available and accessible. Residential appliance use, water heating, and thermostat settings can be influenced by feedback on energy use, particularly when paired with real-time feedback and/or instructions on how to reduce energy use (Kastner and Stern 2015; Stern et al. 2016; Wynes et al. 2018; Tiefenbeck et al. 2019). The energy-saving potentials of changing occupant behaviour can range between 10% and 25% for residential buildings, and between 5% and 30% for commercial buildings (Zhang et al. 2018). Households are more likely to invest in energy-related home technologies if they believe it financially benefits (rather than disadvantages) them, increases comfort, or will benefit the natural environment (Kastner and Stern 2015). Social influences and availability of funding for household energy measures also support behaviour change (Kastner and Stern 2015)."

Since AR5, most DGVMs have been upgraded to capture carbon–nitrogen cycle interactions (e.g., (Le Quéré et al., 2018), many also include a representation of wildfire and fire–vegetation interactions (Rabin et al., 2017) and a small number now also account for land management (e.g., wood removal from forests and crop fertilisation harvest of irrigation (Arneth et al., 2017).

In the River Plate basin, urban floods have become more frequent, causing infrastructure damage and sometimes substantial mortality (high confidence) (Barros et al., 2015; Zambrano et al., 2017; Nagy et al., 2019; Mettler-Grove, 2020; Morales-Yokobori, 2021; Oyedotun and Ally, 2021). A large increase in landslides and flash floods is also predicted for the Brazilian portion of SES, where they are responsible for the majority of deaths related to disasters in the country (high confidence) (Debortoli et al., 2017; Haque et al., 2019; Saito et al., 2019; Marengo et al., 2020d; da Fonseca Aguiar and Cataldi, 2021). Due to uncontrolled urban growth, 21.5 million people living in the large Brazilian cities of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte (estimate for 2019 fromIBGE [2020]]) are expected to be exposed to water scarcity, despite widespread water availability in the region (medium evidence, medium agreement ) (Marengo et al., 2017, Marengo et al., 2020b; Lima and Magaña Rueda, 2018)."

The probability of extended droughts, such as the recently experienced mega-drought (2010–2015), increases to up to 5 events/100 yr (Bozkurt et al., 2017). Snow, glaciers, permafrost and ice sheets will decrease with high confidence (WGI AR6 Table 12.6, Ranasinghe et al., 2021). The observed area and the elevation changes indicate that the Echaurren Norte glacier may disappear in the coming years if negative mass balance rates prevail (medium confidence) (Farías-Barahona et al., 2019)."

In CSA, the awareness of climate change as a threat is increasing, a situation related to growth in climate justice activism and to the occurrence of extreme weather events of all kinds (high confidence) (Forero et al., 2014; Magrin et al., 2014; Capstick et al., 2015). Perception of climate change is positively associated across countries with the HDI and ND-Gain Readiness Index and negatively associated with the Vulnerability Index and, within countries, with education level, while perception is negatively associated with the degree of political affinity for the market economy (Azócar et al., 2021). However, some communities do not associate their problems with the scientific concept of climate change, so discussions on whether it is human induced and its causes or relationship with other problems can become irrelevant (Sapiains Arrué and Ugarte Caviedes, 2017). Even communities affected by the same changes do not necessarily perceive them in the same way (Bonatti et al., 2016). The interpretations of change, as well as its causes and effects, can vary widely (Paerregaard, 2018; Scoville-Simonds, 2018). Rather than adapting to climate change, some people adapt climate change to their social worlds (Rasmussen, 2016a)."

Many case studies have been conducted on the region, but data to assess and monitor precisely the effects of climate- and weather-related disasters in migration and displacements from a broad perspective remain inaccurate (Priotto and Salvador Aruj, 2017; Abeldaño Zuñiga and Fanta Garrido, 2020). The most common climatic drivers include tropical storms and hurricanes, heavy rains, floods and droughts (Kaenzig and Piguet, 2014). Positive climatic conditions also can facilitate migration (Gray and Bilsborrow, 2013). Peru, Colombia and Guatemala are among the countries with the largest average displacements caused by hydro-meteorological causes; Brazil had 295,000 people displaced because of disasters in 2019 (Global Internal Displacement Database, https://www.internal-displacement.org/database/displacement-data)."

Two impacts related to warmer air conditions are the displacement of the freezing line currently placed at 5100 MASL (Basantes-Serrano et al., 2016), followed by glacier retreat and the upward displacement of mountainous ecosystems (very high confidence) (Vuille et al., 2018; Cuesta et al., 2019). The key ecosystem that regulates water provision for the city is the paramo, and only about 5% of this process is related to glaciers, so the combined effects of climate change on both systems, coupled with land use change and fires, can reduce the availability of water for agriculture, human consumption and hydropower. Other important climatic hazards and impacts are the increase of solar radiation, the heat island effect and fires (high confidence) (Anderson et al., 2011; Armenteras et al., 2020; Ranasinghe et al., 2021). On almost half of the days of each year, Quito’s population is exposed to levels of UV radiation above 11 according to the World Health Organization scale (Municipio del Distrito Metropolitano de Quito, 2016)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#FAQ 12.1_p5,weather,"Governments in the region have implemented several poverty-reduction programmes. However, policies of income redistribution and poverty alleviation do not necessarily improve climate risk management, so complementary policies integrating both social and material conditions are required. A study in northern Brazil showed that risk management strategies for droughts and food insecurity did not change poverty rates between 1997–1998 and 2011–2012. Major shocks, such as climate and extreme weather events (e.g., floods, heavy rains, droughts, frost), reduce and destroy public and private property. For instance, the ENSO event of 2017 in Peru caused losses estimated between USD 6 and 9 billion, affected more than a million inhabitants and generated 370,000 new poor. In total, losses by unemployment, deaths, destruction and damage to infrastructure and houses were around 1.3% of the GDP of Peru."

The net health benefits of controlling air pollution as part of climate mitigation efforts could reach trillions of dollars annually, depending on the air quality policies adopted globally (Markandya et al. 2018; Scovronick et al. 2019b). Air pollution reductions resulting from meeting the Paris Agreement targets were estimated to provide health co-benefits-to-mitigation ratios of between 1.4 and 2.5 (Markandya et al. 2018). In Asia, the benefit of air pollution reduction through mitigation measures was estimated to reduce premature mortality by 0.79 million, with an associated health benefit of USD2.8 trillion versus mitigation costs of USD840 billion, equating to 6% and 2% of GDP, respectively (Xie et al. 2018). Similarly, stabilising radiative forcing to 3.4 W m –2 in South Korea could cost USD1.3–8.5 billion in 2050 and could lead to a USD23.5 billion cost reduction from the combined benefits of avoided premature mortality, health expenditures, and lost work hours (Kim et al. 2020). The health co-benefits related to physical exercise and reduced air pollution largely offset the costs of implementing low-CO2-emitting urban mobility strategies in three Austrian cities (Wolkinger et al. 2018)."

Drivers of impacts on biodiversity, ecosystem function and ecosystem services have been assessed in reports by the IPCC, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) and the Global Environmental Outlook (Settele et al., 2014; FAO, 2018; IPBES, 2018b; IPBES, 2018e; IPBES, 2018c; IPBES, 2018d; IPBES, 2019; UNEP, 2019; Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, 2020). Most recently, the IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL) provided an assessment on land degradation and desertification, GHG emissions and food security in the context of global warming (IPCC, 2019c), and the IPBES–IPCC joint report on biodiversity and climate change provided a synthesis of the current understanding of the interactions, synergies and feedbacks between biodiversity and climate change (Pörtner et al., 2021). This chapter builds on and expands the results of these assessments."

The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment defined ecosystem services as ‘the benefits people obtain from ecosystems’ including ‘provisioning services such as food and water; regulating services such as regulation of floods, drought, land degradation, and disease; supporting services such as soil formation and nutrient cycling; and cultural services such as recreational, spiritual, religious, and other nonmaterial benefits’ (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005)."

Beneficial contributions from nature include such things as food provision, water purification, flood control, and artistic inspiration, whereas detrimental contributions include disease transmission and predation that damages people or their assets’ (IPBES, 2019). The concept was modified to include more social viewpoints and broaden the analyses beyond narrow economic stock-and-flow valuation approaches (Díaz et al., 2018). IPBES developed a classification of 18 categories of ecosystem services (see Table 2.1)."

However, biota can recover rapidly from extreme flood events if river geomorphology is not greatly altered. If instream habitat is strongly affected, recovery, if it occurs, takes much longer, resulting in a decline of biodiversity (medium confidence) (Thorp et al., 2010; Death et al., 2015; Poff et al., 2018)."

Given that the ecological consequences of lake warming may be especially strong in the Tropics (Section 2.3.1.1), ecosystem services may be most affected there. Tropical lakes support important fisheries (Lynch et al., 2016a; McIntyre et al., 2016) that provide a critical source of nutrition to adjacent human populations. These lakes are especially prone to the loss of deep-water oxygen due to warming, with adverse consequences for the productivity of fisheries and for biodiversity (medium evidence, medium agreement ) (Lewis Jr, 2000; Van Bocxlaer et al., 2012)."

While biodiversity and several ecosystem services can be considered synergistic (food webs, tourism and of aesthetic and spiritual value) (Langhans et al., 2019), others can be considered antagonistic in case of a strong ecosystem service demand (such as water abstraction, water use and food security in terms of overexploitation). Here, the balance between biodiversity and ecosystem services is key (Langhans et al., 2019), where biodiversity can be integrated into water policy by means of integrated water resource management (IWRM) towards NbS (Ligtvoet et al., 2017)"
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.3.6.3_p1,ecosystem services,"River banks, riparian vegetation and macrophyte beds play important roles in erosion control through reducing current velocities, increasing sedimentation and reducing turbidity (Madsen et al., 2001). Rates of flow in rivers affect inland navigation (Vári et al., 2022). Changing seasonality in snow-dominated basins is expected to enhance hydropower production in winter but decrease it during summer (Doell et al., 2015). Glacier melt changes hydrological regimes, sediment transport and bio-geochemical and contaminant fluxes from rivers to oceans, profoundly influencing ecosystem services that glacier-fed rivers provide, particularly the provision of water for agriculture, hydropower and consumption (Milner et al., 2017). Loss of glacial mass and snowpack has already impacted flow rates, quantities and seasonality (Chapter 4, in this report) (Hock et al., 2019). Meltwater yields from glacier ice are likely to increase in many regions during the next decades but decrease thereafter, as glaciers become smaller and smaller and finally disappear (Hock et al., 2019)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.4_p1,ecosystem services;invasive species,"Among numerous risks to terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems from climate change, this chapter identified five phenomena as the most fundamental risks of climate change to ecosystem integrity and the ecosystem services that support human well-being that are also quantified sufficiently to estimate risk thresholds with at least medium confidence : Biodiversity loss (global losses of species from ecosystems), ecosystem structure change, increased tree mortality, increased wildfire, and ecosystem carbon losses and (Table 2.5, Table SM2.5; Figure 2.11). These key risks form part of the overall assessment of key risks in Chapter 16. The AR5 chapter on terrestrial ecosystems (Settele et al., 2014) had also identified three of these key risks—species extinctions, tree mortality and ecosystem carbon losses—and a fourth—invasion by non-native species. This chapter assesses, in multiple sections, the impacts of climate change on invasive species with respect to different processes or systems (e.g., in Section 2.4.2.3.3), and includes this aspect here in a new broader key risk of ecosystem structure change. The AR5 included wildfire as a mechanism of the key risk of ecosystem carbon loss. Based on additional research and field experience with major wildfires since then, this chapter sets wildfire apart as a specific key risk to ecosystem integrity and human well-being. These different measures of risk are interconnected, but approach the assessment of the risks to terrestrial and freshwater ecosytems from different angles, using complementary metrics."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6 _p2,ecosystem services,"Previous sections of this chapter have set out the vulnerability of natural and semi-natural ecosystems to climate change, and the risks this poses to both biodiversity and ecosystem services (also sometimes described as ‘Nature’s Contributions to People’). Natural systems respond to climatic and other environmental changes in a variety of ways. Individual organisms can respond through growth, movement and developmental processes. Species and populations genetically adapt to changing conditions and evolve over successive generations. Geomorphological features, such as the path of watercourses, can also change naturally in response to climate change. However, there is a limit to which these natural processes can maintain biodiversity and the benefits people derive from nature, partly due to intrinsic limits, but also because of the pressures that people exert on the natural environment."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.3_p2,ecosystem services,"EbA includes a range of different approaches. Examples include restoring coastal and river systems to reduce flood risk and improve water quality, and the creation of natural areas within urban areas to reduce temperatures through shading and evaporative cooling. EbA is closely linked with a variety of other concepts such as ecosystem services, natural capital and disaster risk reduction (DRR). EbA was becoming a well-recognised concept at the time of AR5 but implementation was still at an early stage in many cases. Since then, pilot studies have been assessed and EbA projects have been initiated around the world. The evidence base continues to grow (Table 2.7), and this has led to increasing confidence in approaches which have been shown to work leading to further expansion in some countries (Table 2.7). However, this is not uniform and there is relatively little synthesis across disciplines and regions (Seddon et al., 2020a). Chausson et al. (2020) used a systematic mapping methodology to characterise 386 published studies. They found that interventions in natural or semi-natural ecosystems ameliorated adverse climate change impacts in 66% of cases, with fewer trade-offs than for more artificial systems such as plantation forest. However, the evidence base has substantial gaps. Most of the evidence has been collected in the Global North, and there is a lack of robust, site-specific investigations into the effectiveness of interventions compared to alternatives and more holistic appraisals that account for broader social and ecological outcomes."

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.7_p1,ecosystem services,"CRD is the subject of Chapter 18. This section briefly assesses some of the fundamental issues for CRD relating to ecosystems. An overview of the importance of specific ecosystem services for CRD is presented in Box 18.7 in Chapter 18. A large body of evidence has demonstrated the extent to which human life, well-being and economies are dependent on healthy ecosystems and also the range of threats that these are faced with (high confidence) (IPBES, 2019; Dasgupta, 2021; Pörtner et al., 2021). An analysis of 64 studies found a strong positive synergy among eight critical regulating services of healthy ecosystems, including climate regulation, water provisioning, pest and disease control and adjacent-crop pollination (Lee and Lautenbach, 2016). The health of ecosystems is, in turn, reliant upon the maintenance of natural levels of species’ richness and functional diversity (high confidence) (Lavorel et al., 2020) (see Section 2.5.4). A meta-analysis of 74 studies documented that the mechanism for increased ecosystem stability is increased asynchrony among species, which itself is a product of greater species diversity (Xu et al., 2021b). Responding to these threats requires the protection and restoration of natural and semi-natural ecosystems, together with sustainable management of other areas."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.6.7_p2,ecosystem services,"The CBD set the Aichi 2020 Target at 17% of each country to be protected for biodiversity. Analyses suggest that 30% or even 50% of land and sea needs to be protected or restored to confer adequate protection for species and ecosystem services (high confidence) (Dinerstein et al., 2019; Woodley et al., 2019; Brooks et al., 2020; Hannah et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020; Sala et al., 2021). Hannah et al. (2020) estimated that limiting warming to 2°C and protecting 30% of high-biodiversity regions (in Africa, Asia and Latin America) reduced the risk of species’ extinctions by half (medium confidence). The placement of protected areas is as important as the total area (Pimm et al., 2018), and the quality of the protection (strictness and enforcement) is as important as the official land designation (Shah et al., 2021). Pimm et al. (2018) found that many small protected areas are successful because they are in areas of very high biodiversity containing species with small range sizes, while many large regions identified as wild are often of low biodiversity value even though they may have a high mitigation value (e.g., the high Arctic tundra). A global meta-analysis of 89 restoration projects found that biodiversity increased by 44% and ecosystem services by 25% after restoration but values remained lower than in intact reference systems (Rey Benayas et al., 2009)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#FAQ 2.6_p5,ecosystem services,"Not everywhere is suitable for tree planting. It is particularly problematic in native non-forested ecosystems. These natural ecosystems are not deforested and degraded but are instead naturally occurring non-forested ecosystems. These areas vary from open grasslands to densely wooded savannas and shrublands. Here, restoring the natural ecosystems instead of afforesting them will better contribute to increasing carbon storage and increasing the area’s resilience to climate change and other environmental changes. It is important to remember that, just because a tree can grow somewhere, it does not mean that it should. These systems are very important in their own right, storing carbon in soils, supporting rich biodiversity and providing people with important ecosystem services such as grasslands for animal grazing. Planting trees in these areas destroys the ecosystem and threatens the biodiversity which is adapted to these environments. They can also impact on ecosystem services such as forage for livestock, on which many people rely."

The material basis for poor and vulnerable urban and rural populations’ adaptations is in a critical state across the CSA region, magnifying extreme events’ impacts, making CSA less resilient. Consequences in terms of social vulnerability and livelihood will be widely felt, inasmuch as the security and protection of critical assets (housing, infrastructure and water, land and ecosystem services) continue to lag behind.

This process degraded the ability of coastal ecosystems, such as mangroves, to reduce risks and provide essential ecosystem services, which help to prevent coastal erosion or maintain fish stocks. Moreover, it reduced ports and tourism, along with income opportunities."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#FAQ 12.4_p7,ecosystem services,"Agroforestry systems are present in the tropical region of CSA. Trees are present in a large part of the agricultural landscape of this region, either dispersed or in lines, supporting the production of coffee, cocoa, fruits, pastures and livestock in various agroforestry configurations. In CA, shade-grown coffee reduces weed control and improves the quality and taste of the product. Agroforestry uses nitrogen-fixing trees (Leguminosae), such as Leucaena in Colombia and Inga in Brazil, to restore soil nitrogen fertility. Tropical forest soils are generally nutrient-poor and unsuited to long-term agricultural use. Land converted to agriculture by cutting and burning natural vegetation tends to remain productive for only a few years. Agroforestry and so-called silvopastoral systems, which incorporate trees into crop and livestock systems, have been shown to have a dramatic impact on the maintenance and restoration of long-term productivity in agricultural landscapes, including degraded and abandoned land. Agroforestry systems can provide major benefits through enhanced food security, stronger local economies and increased ecosystem services such as carbon storage, regulation of climate and water cycles, control of pests and diseases and maintenance of soil fertility. Because of these multiple goods and services, agroforestry practices are considered one of the key strategies for the development of climate-smart agriculture."

In contrast, the literature on natural systems tends to focus on hazards, which include natural or human-induced physical events, impacts, or trends with the potential to cause negative effects on ecosystems and environmental resources. Hazards are affected by current and future changes in climate, including altered climate variability and extreme events (Ranasinghe et al., 2021). Hazards can occur suddenly (e.g., a heat wave or heavy rain event), or more slowly (e.g., land loss, degradation and erosion linked to multiple climate hazards compounding). Observed exposure and risks to protected areas are assessed in Section 2.5.3.1.1. See also Cross-Chapter Box EXTREMES in this chapter."

A better understanding of the impact of the economy on the environment and the contribution of the environment to the economy is critical for identifying opportunities for innovation and promoting activities that could lead to sustainable economic growth without depleting natural resources and increasing sensitivity to climate change and climate variability. The consideration of food as a commodity instead of a common resource leads to the accumulation of underpriced food resources at the expense of natural capital. Without serious emissions reduction measures, climate models project an average 1°C to 4°C increase in maximum temperatures and a 30% decrease in rainfall up to 2050, across CSA. Tropical SA is projected to warm at higher rates than the southern part of SA. Given these circumstances, some regions in CSA (Andes region and CA) will just meet or fall below the critical food supply/demand ratio for their population. Meanwhile, the temperate southern-most region of SA is projected to have agricultural production surplus. The challenge for this region will be to retain the ability to feed and adequately nourish its internal population as well as make an important contribution to food supplies available to the rest of the world."

Observations of desert-greening show good agreement with earlier projections.

The temporal and spatial scale of studies also affects estimates of impacts. The most extreme published estimates of biological change tend to be derived from smaller areas and/or shorter time frames (Daskalova et al., 2021); a recent large global analysis of data for 12,415 species found that differences in study methodology accounted for most of the explained variance in reported range shifts (Lenoir et al., 2020). The importance of LULCC is frequently stressed, but there is a paucity of studies actually quantifying the relative effects of climate change and LULCC on species and communities. (Sirami et al., 2017) found only 13 such studies: four concluded that effects of LULCC overrode those of climate change, four found that the two drivers independently affected different species and five found that they acted in synergy."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.3_p2,invasive species,"Non-climatic hazards such as LUC, habitat fragmentation, pollution and invasive species have been the primary drivers of change in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems in the past (high confidence) (Figure 2.1). These impacts have been extensively documented in reports by the IPBES (2021). However, while climate change has not been the predominant influence to date, its relative impact is increasing (IPCC SRCCL), with greater interactive effects of non-climate and climate hazards now occurring (Birk et al., 2020)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.3.1_p6,invasive species,"For example, strong dispersers are less at risk, while species with low dispersal ability, small ranges and long lifespans (e.g., many plants, especially trees, many amphibians and some small mammals) are more at risk (IPCC, 2014b; Hamann et al., 2015) . This is likely to favour generalist and invasive species, altering species composition, ecosystem structure and function (Clavel et al., 2011; Büchi and Vuilleumier, 2014). The ability to track suitable climates is substantially reduced by habitat fragmentation and human modifications of the landscape such as dams on rivers and urbanisation (high confidence). Freshwater systems are particularly at risk of rapid warming, given their naturally fragmented distribution. Velocity of changes in surface temperature of inland standing waters globally was estimated as being 3.5 ± 2.3 km per decade from 1861 to 2005. From 2006 to 2099, this is projected to increase from 8.7 ± 5.5 km (representative concentration pathway, RCP2.6) to 57.0 ± 17.0 km (RCP8.5) per decade (Woolway and Maberly, 2020). Although the dispersal of the aerial adult stage of some aquatic insects can surpass these climate velocities, rates of change under mid- and high-emission scenarios (RCP4.5, RCP6.0, RCP8.5) are substantially higher than the known rates of the active dispersal of many species (Woolway and Maberly, 2020). Many species, both terrestrial and freshwater, are not expected to be able to disperse fast enough to track suitable climates under mid- and high-emission scenarios (medium confidence) (RCP4.5, RCP6.0, RCP8.5; (Brito-Morales et al., 2018)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.4.2.3.3_p1,invasive species,"As climate change is increasing the movements of species into new areas, there is concern about how exotic species are being impacted, either by becoming invasive or by already invasive species gaining even more advantage over native species. Modelling predicts that the effects of climate warming on food web structure and stability favour the success of invading species (Sentis et al., 2021). Both simulated warming experiments (Zettlemoyer et al., 2019) and long-term observations (Willis et al., 2010) have found phenologies of exotic species to respond more adaptively to warming than those of natives; in the long-term observations, the success of exotics was attributed to their greater phenological responsiveness. In an expert assessment of the future relative importance of different drivers of the impacts of biological invasions, climate change was named as the most important driver in polar regions, second-most important in temperate regions (after trade/transport), and third-most important in the tropics (after trade/transport and human demography/migration) (Essl et al., 2020)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.1.3.1_p1,invasive species,"This assessment of current findings is of studies across a range of taxa and modelling techniques. Extinction risk estimates whether or not a particular species may be at risk of extinction over the coming decades if climatic trends continue, and usually does not take into account other human-induced stressors (e.g., invasive species or pollution). It is not a prediction that a species will definitely become extinct because, even when complete loss of a species’ range is projected, the scale of the model cannot estimate persistence in very small-scale micro-climatic refugia (that can be on the order of metres in size) (Suggitt et al., 2015; Suggitt et al., 2018). Individuals and populations can survive after the conditions for successful reproduction are gone, leading to a lagged decline, called ‘extinction debt’ (see section 2.4.2.8) (Alexander et al., 2018). Therefore, range loss is an established criterion for assessing endangerment status and risk of extinction. As a species range becomes smaller and occupied habitats become more isolated, the likelihood of a single stochastic event causing extinction increases. It is this combination of projected loss of climatically suitable space and additional stressors (especially LULCC of critical habitat) that is expected to drive future extinctions."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.3.1.2_p5,invasive species,"Terrestrial and freshwater protected areas can also serve as climate change refugia, that is, locations where suitable conditions may persist for the species into the future (e.g., Section 2.6.5.6). In Canada, Mexico and the USA, only a fraction of the protected area is located in potential climate change refugia under a 4°C temperature increase, estimated at 4% (Michalak et al., 2018) to 7% (Batllori et al., 2017). Potential refugia from biome shifts due to climate change under temperature increases of 1.8°C–3.4°C cover <1% of the area of US national parks (Gonzalez et al., 2010), a fraction that diminishes to near zero when climate change is combined with habitat fragmentation due to LUC (Eigenbrod et al., 2015). Protected areas in boreal ecosystems could serve as refugia for species shifting north in Canada (Berteaux et al., 2018) and Finland (Lehikoinen et al., 2019). Invasive species, habitat loss and other disturbances in protected areas could be lower than in unprotected areas across Europe (Gallardo et al., 2017), specifically in Spain (Regos et al., 2016), and also in Sri Lanka (Kariyawasam et al., 2020). Protected areas conserve refugia from climate change under a temperature increase of 4°C, which is important for biodiversity conservation but is limited to <10% of the current protected area (medium confidence)."

Monitoring can reveal which streams, wetlands, springs and other aquatic resources retain suitable discharges, water quality, wetland area and ecological integrity, especially during dry years (Cartwright et al., 2020). Measures to conserve drought refugia may include protecting springs and other groundwater-fed systems from groundwater extraction, contamination, salinisation, surface-water diversion, channelisation of streams, trampling by livestock, recreation activities and invasive species and the effects of disturbances in the surrounding landscape (Cartwright et al., 2020; Krawchuk et al., 2020).

Phenological studies have documented particularly consistent conclusions on responses of plants and animals to warming, including the advancement of spring events and the lengthening of growing seasons in temperate regions (via a combination of advancement of spring events and, to a lesser extent, the retardation of autumn events) (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Table 2.2, Table 2.3, Table SM2.1) (Menzel et al., 2020). In the Tropics, by contrast, changes in precipitation have more strongly influenced animal phenology than have temperature changes (Cohen et al., 2018). A meta-analysis compared observed phenological advances in birds with expectations due to warming local climates, and concluded that the observed advances fell short of what was expected and that a substantial phenological climate debt had been generated (Radchuk et al., 2019)."

Warren et al. (2013) used combinations of SDMs and trait-based approaches to estimate the proportions of species losing their climatically suitable ranges under the various future scenarios of climate and dispersal rate. Similarly, spatial projections of exposure to climate change were combined with traits to assess the vulnerability of sub-Saharan amphibians (Garcia et al., 2014). Laurance et al. (2012) combined 31 functional groups of species and 21 potential drivers of environmental change, in order to assess both the ecological integrity and threats to protected tropical areas on a global scale. Keith et al.

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.1.3.1_p2,IUCN,"The IUCN Red List Criteria (IUCN, 2019) classifies a species as ‘critically endangered’ if it has suffered a range loss of ≥80%, with a resulting likelihood of extinction of >50% in the near term (10–100 yrs, depending upon generation length). A species is classified as ‘endangered’ if it has suffered a range loss of ≥50%, with a resulting likelihood of extinction of >20% in the near term (10–100 years). In this assessment, a species that is projected to become classified as ‘endangered’ is deemed to be at ‘high risk’ of extinction, and becoming classified as ‘critically endangered’ is deemed at ‘very high risk’ of extinction."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.1.3.3_p2,IUCN,"In this chapter, risk to species, with implications for ecosystems, is assessed using three different approaches. First is an assessment of the geographic distributions of local species’ losses at different levels of GSAT warming, termed ‘local biodiversity loss’, measured as the proportion of species within a given location becoming classified as “endangered” or worse  (sensu IUCN), and so at highrisk of local population losses (local population extinctions) (Figure 2.6). This measure provides the best estimates of which sites are at most risk of losing substantial numbers of species locally, leading to degradation of that ecosystem’s ability to function."

This measure is closest to assessing the complete loss of a species in the wild and can be used to compare to past (palaeo) extinction rates. These three approaches provide complementary information of the overall risks to individual species, to biodiversity at the community scale, and to ecosystem integrity and functioning at different levels of warming."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.1.3.3_p7,IUCN,"Risk of local biodiversity loss, estimated as the proportion of species in a given area projected to become endangered (sensu IUCN), and therefore at highrisk of extinction, is projected to affect a greater number of regions experiencing increasing warming. About one-third of land area risks more than 50% of species becoming “endangered” by 4.0° GSAT warming (Figure 2.6). That is, the deep orange and red areas in Figure 2.6 are those areas for which >50% of species currently inhabiting those ecosystems are projected to lose >50% of their climatically suitable habitat.

Ten-twenty percent losses represent high and very highrisk of biodiversity losses, respectively, substantial enough to reduce ecosystem integrity and functioning (medium confidence) (Figure 2.8b) (see Section 2.5.4; Figure 2.11; Table 2.5, Table SM2.5)."

Maximum estimates of species at very highrisk of extinction reach 60% within the 95% quartiles, ie the very likely  range, for 5°C GSAT warming. Among the groups containing the largest numbers of species at a very high risk of extinction for mid-levels of projected warming (3.2°C rise in GSAT) are: invertebrates (15%), specifically pollinators (12%), amphibians (11%, but 24% for salamanders) and flowering plants (10%) (Figure 2.8a).

cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter02#2.5.1.3.3_p15,IUCN,"Most of the large-scale studies that have been performed are for losses based on climate alone (Figures 2.6, 2.7, 2.8). However, climate is rarely the only stressor affecting species survival. Habitat loss is currently the largest driver of range loss and extinction risk for most species (IUCN, 2019). Communities in different regions are becoming more similar to each other as species tolerant of human activities prosper and spread, with many rare and endemic species already having been driven to extinction, primarily by LULCC (Pimm et al., 2006). Thus, it will likely be the interaction of climate change and habitat conversion (often driven by climate change) that will ultimately determine the risk and ability of many species to survive over the next century."

Therefore, this level—10%—of species becoming “endangered” (sensu IUCN),and therefore at high risk of extinction, due to the loss of suitable climate space (Figure 2.8b), is used here as a threshold, moving the risk to biodiversity from moderate to high, and twice that (20%) as the threshold from high to very high."

Furthermore, accounting frameworks are reflected in multiple protocols used by urban practitioners (BSI 2013; Fong et al. 2014; ICLEI 2019b). Synthesis of these reviews and protocols, as well as the many individual methodological studies available, point to four general frameworks of urban GHG accounting: (i) territorial accounting (TA); (ii) community-wide infrastructure supply chain footprinting (CIF); and (iii and iv) consumption-based carbon footprint accounting (CBCF; Wiedmann and Minx 2008). The last, CBCF, can be further divided into accounting with a focus on household or personal consumption (iii: the personal carbon footprint, or PCF); and an approach in which one includes final consumption in an area by all consumers (iv: the areal carbon footprint, or ACF) (Heinonen et al. 2020). A number of small variations to these general categories are found in the literature (Lin et al. 2015; Chen et al. 2020a), but these four general frameworks capture the important distinctive (i.e., policy-relevant) features of urban GHG accounting."

This estimate includes all CO2 and CH4 emissions except aviation, shipping, and biogenic sources (i.e., land-use change, forestry, and agriculture). About 100 of the highest-emitting urban areas account for approximately 18% of the global carbon footprint (Moran et al. 2018).

This process has lead to increases of species richness on mountaintops and decreased richness at adjacent lower elevations (medium evidence, high agreement ) (Forister et al., 2010; Steinbauer et al., 2018). While it is also expected from observed range shifts of individual species that species richness should increase along tropical/temperate ecotones and along temperate/boreal ecotones, to date this has not been well documented. Lewthwaite et al (Lewthwaite and Mooers, 2022) documented a small increase in local richness across Canada for 265 species of butterflies, but the stronger effect was an homogenization across the region, with generalist species generally expanding into new sites and leading to lower Beta-diversity (lower diversity among sites). In a study of 66 bumble bee species across North America and Europe, Soroye et al (Soroye et al., 2020) did not find the expected pattern, with most sites, regardless of latitude, declining in species richness, even when individual species benefited from warming or increased precipitation at some sites. Observed shifts in community composition have consequences for species’ interactions. Such indirect effects of climate change have been shown to often have greater impacts on species than the direct effects of climate itself, particularly for higher-level consumers (Cahill et al., 2013; Ockendon et al., 2014)."

Climate-driven upwards migration of species, associated with warming and glacier retreat, has modified species distribution and richness and community composition along the Andes altitudinal gradient (Seimon et al., 2017; Carilla et al., 2018; Zimmer et al., 2018; Moret et al., 2019). Climate-driven glacier retreat alters hydrological regimes, directly impacting Andean pastoralists (López-i-Gelats et al., 2016; Postigo, 2020; Thompson et al., 2021) and the provision of water to lowland regions (Vuille et al., 2018; Hock et al., 2019; Orlove et al., 2019; Rasul and Molden, 2019). The drying of wetlands has modified alpine plant communities, which are relevant for storing carbon, regulating water and providing food for local livestock; this has led to negative impacts on herders’ livelihoods (Dangles et al., 2017; Polk et al., 2017; Postigo, 2020) and affecting the wild vicuña and the domesticated alpaca and llama. The wool from Vicuña (Vicugna vicugna) and alpaca (V. pacos) is an important source of income for indigenous communities and the llama (Lama glama) is their main source of meat. Vicuña are adjusting their feeding behaviour and spatial distribution as vegetation migrates upwards (Reider and Schmidt, 2020), causing them to roam outside protected areas and become vulnerable to illegal poaching."

Data were derived from Romanello et al. (2021)."
cleaned_content/wg2/Chapter12#12.6.2_p5,slash and burn,"The Indigenous agricultural practices that led to ADEs are thought to be associated with a more sedentary agricultural model than the current slash-and-burn and shifting cultivation practices. Although this is a controversial topic, as the precise definitions of slash and burn and shifting cultivation are presently under discussion (Hecht, 2003), several present-day local and Indigenous agricultural practices, including in-field burning and nutrient additions from food processing and residue management, have been recognised as promoting high organic carbon and nutrient soil contents similar to those found in ADEs (Hecht, 2003; Winklerprins, 2009)."
cleaned_content/wg3/Chapter08#8.5.2_p3,climate legislation,"These estimates are also often contingent on assumptions that subnational actors fulfil their pledges and that these actions do not result in rollbacks in climate action (i.e., weakening of national climate legislation) from other actors or rebound in emissions growth elsewhere, but data tracking or quantifying the likelihood of their implementation remains rare (Chan et al. 2018; Hsu et al. 2019; Hale et al. 2020; Kuramochi et al. 2020). Reporting networks may attract high-performing cities, suggesting an artificially high level of cities interested in taking climate action or piloting solutions that may not be effective elsewhere (van der Heijden 2018). These studies could also present a conservative view of potential mitigation impact because they draw upon publicly reported mitigation actions and inventory data, excluding subnational actors that may be taking actions but not reporting them (Kuramochi et al. 2020). The nuances of likelihood, and the drivers and obstacles of climate action across different contexts is a key source of uncertainty around subnational actors’ mitigation impacts."
